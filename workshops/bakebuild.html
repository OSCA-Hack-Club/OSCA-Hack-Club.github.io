The assets that everyone makes will be available for others to use to customize their islands in the following steps.\n\n## Customizing your island 🎀\nNow you know the basics of Spline, **it's time to start making the island your own**. Transform this basic house into your dream mansion, expand your island with more structures, or start from scratch to build something unique!\n\n\u003e Here are some ideas for what to make:\n\u003e - A park\n\u003e - A town in the wild west\n\u003e - Your dream house or resort\n\u003e - A space station\n\u003e - Recreate a building from your favorite movie or video game\n\u003e - Your school/the building you’re currently in\n\n### Spline’s asset library\nSpline has a ***huge*** library of 3D models and scenes for you to use in your project! Sprinkle little details into your island or add full building prefabs to form towns and parks.\n\n![Spline's asset library](https://cloud-kv6txjh6s-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0splinelibrary.png)\n\n## Build a collaborative sky village by linking islands 🌉\nCollaboration is one of the most fun and fulfilling aspects of design and making, and Spline makes it super easy! If you're working with a group or wanna collab with a few friends, let's build a sky village!\n\n\u003cComment githubUser=\"linkai101\"\u003e\nNote: Spline's free tier currently only has 2 additional editor seats. (file owner + 2 other editors) You could still make it work if everyone sends their islands to the leader(s) who links them together.\n\u003c/Comment\u003e\n\n1. Have the club/group leader create a new file on Spline. Share the file with the rest of the group with editing privileges.\n![Linking islands - Step 1](https://cloud-mn9anfpic-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\n2. Copy and paste each island into this master file. Connect them with bridges in the asset library or find your own creative way to link the islands!\n![Group collab demo](https://cloud-8oi5u7dkg-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\n## What's next 🔮\n3D modeling literally has limitless possibilities. Here are a few:\n- Visualize and manipulate 3D models in HTML with [three.js](https://threejs.org/)\n- 3D printing and inventing\n- Use them in Unity, Unreal Engine, or other 3D game development applications\n- Augmented/visual reality (AR/VR)\n- Just for fun or for the sake of art—create and showcase a portfolio!\n\nI wonder what you'll build next with 3D! 😁\n\n### Exporting\nOften in big projects like making 3D games and websites, 3D modeling is only one side of the story. You'll eventually need to export them into another app, and here's how you do it:\n\n\u003cComment githubUser=\"linkai101\"\u003e\nKeep in mind that some export options are only available to the paid tiers. 😐 You should be able to get by though!\n\u003c/Comment\u003e\n\n1. In the toolbar, click on \"Export\". There will be options on the left-hand side for various file formats to export to.\n![Exporting](https://cloud-ctimzr33x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\n### Jams to do next\n\u003e Looking for more 3D jams?

Imagine big forests, huge deserts, all the things in your imagination coming to life.\n\n**Outline:**\n1. Setting up Replit\n2. What's A-Frame?\n3. Adding A-Frame\n4. Creating a scene\n5.

Wrapping up\n## Setting up Replit \nGo to [https://replit.com](https://replit.com) and create/log into an account:\n![Replit authentication page](https://cloud-99ig98peo-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nThen, go ahead and create a project by going to \"Create Repl\" on the sidebar \u003e selecting HTML, CSS, JS \u003e giving it a title \u003e hitting \"Create Repl\"\n\n![Creating HTML CSS JS Repl](https://cloud-p82fpfgs2-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0outputgif.gif)\n\n## What's A-Frame?\n\n![aframe logo](https://cloud-m5c3nxgbo-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nBuilding 3D worlds used to be pretty hard to approach due to its high learning curve. A-Frame is a library to help make this stuff MUCH easier. Instead of getting lost in the weeds, it provides a simple interface for you to create 3D websites.\n\nHere are some of the amazing things people have made with A-Frame:\n1. [A-Blast](https://aframe.io/a-blast/)\n![a-blast ui](https://cloud-3j84pfit2-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n2.

[Moonrider](https://moonrider.xyz/)\n![moonrider ui](https://cloud-rcqx7la5t-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\n## Adding A-Frame\n\nHey, do you notice the `\u003chead\u003e` tag in our HTML? Yeah, we can add a script via the  `\u003cscript\u003e` tag to give our website A-Frame's superpowers! Put this within the `\u003chead\u003e`\n\n```js\n\u003cscript src=\"https://aframe.io/releases/1.6.0/aframe.min.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n```\n![instructions of putting script within head tag](https://cloud-byterps5u-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\n## Creating a scene\n\nTo actually use A-Frame, we need to create a scene to add elements. We can do so with the `\u003ca-scene\u003e` tag\n\nRemove the \"Hello world\" text within the `\u003cbody\u003e` tags and add:\n\n```html\n\u003ca-scene\u003e\n\u003c/a-scene\u003e\n```\n\nAll of our elements will go here. What are these elements you might ask?\n## Adding elements\n\nA-Frame has different tags for different 3D elements. For example, you can use `\u003ca-box\u003e` to create a cube, and `\u003ca-sphere\u003e` to create a ball.\n\nHere are all the different kinds of elements (use `\u003ca-[ELEMENT-NAME]\u003e` to use these):\n![showcase of all a-frame tags](https://cloud-69ehuc8ev-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\n![visual map of entities in a scene](https://cloud-mgilf4sx7-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nWithin your `\u003ca-scene\u003e`, add a box:\n\n```html\n\u003ca-scene\u003e\n\t\u003ca-box\u003e\u003c/a-box\u003e\n\u003c/a-scene\u003e\n```\n\nClick on the panel on the right and use your WASD keys + mouse to move around. You should see a box after you move around (click the run button at the top of the page if nothing shows up):\n![demo of white box ](https://cloud-klvbtj50y-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screen_recording_june_17.gif)\n\nHmm, we should probably have some color. After all, things are much better with colors!\n\nTo do this you can add the `color` attribute to `\u003ca-box\u003e`! For example, you can do `\u003ca-box color=\"blue\"\u003e\u003c/a-box\u003e` to get a blue cube.\n\nChoose any color you want, you can put a [CSS color keyword](https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS/Properties/color/keywords) or a hex code (like `#000`) as a color. \n\n## Attributes\n\nThere are lots of attributes (A-Frame calls them components) that you can add to your objects. For example, there is the `position` attribute that allows you to put your object in a certain position in space (e.g. `position=\"1 0 3\"` correlates to the x, y, and z positions respectively).\n\nExperiment with these attributes (Google for more!) and build something amazing.\n\nSome example props you can play around with are:\n1. `animation`: animates the objects (you can use these to move your object)\n2. `rotation`: rotate your object, allows for fun designs\n\n## Customization\n\nWhile you probably just have a cube right now, you can add so much more!\n\nWant to add physics? There's [a library](https://github.com/c-frame/aframe-physics-system/blob/master/CannonDriver.md#installation) for that. Want to create a cool environment? Check out [this](https://github.com/supermedium/aframe-environment-component) environment component!\n\nThe possibilities are truly endless with A-Frame, and it's super easy to share your site as well!\n\n## Deploying your site\n\nIt's really simple to deploy your site. Go to https://netlify.app and create an account.\n\nAfter doing so, go to Replit and download your files as a `.zip` file. You can do this by clicking the three dots above all your files and clicking \"Download as ZIP\":\n\n![image of ui to download as zip](https://cloud-ecgsox4ue-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nAfter this, go to https://app.netlify.com/drop and drag and drop your `.zip` file there.\n\nAfter it uploads, click \"Open production deploy\" to see your live site!\n\n![image of opening deploy](https://cloud-bpr687t0e-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\n## Getting a free frappuccino\n\nYou've put so much effort into getting your site up and running—we think you deserve a little treat after all that.

Y'all can go on vacation anywhere, but the question is, where?\n\nTake some time as a club to brainstorm the greatest place to take a vacation. Maybe it could be San Francisco, Los Angeles, or New York City. Whatever it is, take a minute to think of what this vacation would look like and what you all would do.\n\nHowever, you might have run into a problem: you can't think of things to do! For example, in San Francisco, you might think of going to the Golden Gate Bridge, but what else?\n\nThis is where we can use AI and code to solve our problem by making an AI travel itinerary planner:\n![Live Demo Gif](https://cloud-j37pzs32q-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0plantripwithaigif.gif)\n\nTry it out [here](https://replit.com/@ShubhamPatilsd/AI-Trip-Itinerary)!\n\n## Steps\n1. Clone a starter template for HTML CSS and JS \n2. Add inputs: trip destination, trip start date, trip end date\n3. Configure OpenAI API and get your API key \n4. Validate that all inputs are filled in\n5. Send a request to the OpenAI API, with a custom prompt including all the details. Make sure the response comes back in JSON\n7. When results come back, parse the JSON and display the events in a list\n8. Go on your next trip\n\n## Humble beginnings\nSo, you decide to get started! You log onto your laptop and then realize that your school has disabled downloading _anything_ to your computer.\n\nYou take two deep breaths and realize that you can just use Replit to do this.\n\nSo you go to https://replit.com and sign up for an account.\n![login page](https://cloud-2vb2zquzl-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0pasted_image_20230714142545.png)\n\nThen, you create a new project with the HTML, CSS, and JS template\n![create repl](https://cloud-2vb2zquzl-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1pasted_image_20230714142701.png)\n\n\n## Inputting information\nFor our code to know the details of our club trip, we need to have some way to input the destination and dates of our trip.\n\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"How can we do this?\"\u003e\n\n1. Making an `\u003cinput\u003e` element for the location of the trip \n2. Making another `\u003cinput\u003e` element for the start date of the trip \n3. Making a third `\u003cinput\u003e` element for the end date of the trip \n\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n### Inputting trip location\nWhile there are many places we can visit in this world, the club must only select one. To do that, we have to add an `\u003cinput/\u003e` element of type `text` to your HTML code and give it an easy-to-remember `name`:\n```html\n\u003cinput type=\"text\" name=\"location\" /\u003e\n```\nYou should put this between the `\u003cbody\u003e\u003c/body\u003e` tags in your HTML!\n\nIf you save and run your code, on the right side of your screen you should be able to see a textbox that you can type in!\n\n### Adding trip dates\nNow that we can input our trip destination, we need to define some travel dates. The process is similar to adding a text input, but instead of having an `\u003cinput/\u003e` of `type=\"text\"`, we have an input that has `type=\"date\"`.\n\n\n\u003cDropdown title={`What does changing it to \"date\" do?`}\u003e\nHaving a `type` of `\"date\"` tells the browser to render a calendar picker where we can select a date. So, to have a start and end date, we will have two `\u003cinput/\u003e` elements with `type=\"date\"`\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\nUnderneath your `location` input, add two of these and assign them unique names:\n```html\n\u003cinput type=\"date\" name=\"myUniqueName\" /\u003e\n```\n\nAt this stage, you should have something like this:\n![result](https://cloud-2vb2zquzl-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/2pasted_image_20230715110807.png)\n\n\n### Adding more inputs\nHey, sometimes we need more customization for our trips. We can do this by adding more `\u003cinput/\u003e` elements that serve different purposes!\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"Here are some ideas for more inputs:\"\u003e\n1. Specifying the types of activities (e.g. outdoors, museums, food only)\n2. Specifying the budget that your club has for this trip\n3. Having one club member plan meals and have another club member plan activities\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n## Configuring ChatGPT\nChatGPT. ChatGPT is the magical black box of the modern age. We don't know how it works, but it can spit out useful information, and we can especially use it to plan a club outing. \n\n![chatgpt gif](https://media1.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExZHNhMXRoN2U4ZzVjcGVhM2lzamgwZHZsdTl1MW96bTZnbDh6b253MCZlcD12MV9naWZzX3NlYXJjaCZjdD1n/qAtZM2gvjWhPjmclZE/giphy.gif)\n\nChatGPT is actually so powerful that you can give it any trip destination and it will spit out a planned itinerary back. It's practically magic!\n\nUsually, we're used to interacting with ChatGPT using their [website](https://chat.openai.com) like so:\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f04f767ded4a14e876e6190/e99dd562-e62c-469b-8301-3eb8b2dd0f9c/YouTube+Script.gif)\n\nHowever, we can't go and interact with the website using our code! This is why we use the official ChatGPT API.\n\n## What's an API?\nAPI Textbook Definition:\n\u003e  A · P · I \u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003e An application programming interface (API) is a specification intended to be used as an interface by software components to communicate with each other.\n\nOur Cool And Easy to Digest™ Definition:\n\u003e A · P · I \u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003e **An API is the way our code can talk to someone else's code.** Sounds weird right? In this case, OpenAI has their ChatGPT code running in some server somewhere, and our app needs to use ChatGPT. Many people like us also want to use ChatGPT in our code, so OpenAI created something called the \"ChatGPT API\" so we can use ChatGPT's code in our app.\n\n\n\u003cDropdown\ntitle=\"So which API are we using?\"\n\u003e\nGreat question! Let's break down the API structure for ChatGPT!\n![explanation of API](https://cloud-647cibhzc-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0hack_club_jam.png)\n\nWe are going to be using the `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint to get the job done; it's the core technology behind ChatGPT!\n\n\u003e *Psst: Get it? Completions? Like how ChatGPT can \"complete\" an answer to a prompt?*\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"How do I talk to an API?\"\u003e\nDon't worry, talking to APIs is much easier than talking to people ;)\n\nWe can send a ***\"request\"*** to our API in order to talk to it.\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n### Types of Requests\nThere are four types of requests: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE\n\n![](https://cloud-c8wbo8ip9-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image2.png)\n\n\u003e GET: We tell the API to fetch some data for us to use\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003e POST: We tell the API to create some data for us\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003e PUT: We tell the API to update some data for us\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003e DELETE: Obviously, we tell the API to delete some data for us\n\nWe can select which type of request we want to send from our client!\n\n\u003e ⚠️🚨 **Make sure to specify the correct request type!** For example, if you send a `GET` request to an endpoint that requires a `POST` request, your request won't go through :(\n\n### Communicating with the ChatGPT API\nThe ChatGPT API that we're using (`https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`) requires a `POST` request.\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"But hey! POST is for creating data right? Shouldn't we use GET instead, because we're asking for data from the API?\"\u003e\n\nWell, the truth is that API developers set the request type arbitrarily. There's no hard rule on whether to set your API endpoint to use `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, or `DELETE`, it's completely up to the person making that API.\n\nAnd since the person making that API wants to build it quickly, they choose the easiest/best option to use, in this case, it is a `POST` request.\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n\u003cDropdown\ntitle=\"But why is POST the easiest/best in this situation?\"\u003e \n\n[Security](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/33837/get-vs-post-which-is-more-secure). A `POST` request is more secure than a `GET` request.\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n### Request Body\nSince we're going to be sending a `POST` request, that also means that we have to send a **request body** as well.\n\nThink of the request as a cardboard box and the body being the stuff that goes inside that box. We (our browser) can then package and ship that box to the API.\n\n![explanation of api request body](https://cloud-iux06nddt-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0untitled.png)\n\nHere's the request body that we use to communicate with the ChatGPT API:\n```json\n{\n      'model': 'gpt-3.5-turbo',\n      'messages': [\n        {\n          'role': 'user',\n          'content': `What US state is Shelburne in?`\n        }\n    ],\n}\n```\n\nLet's break this down:\n- `model` is selecting which \"brain\" ChatGPT uses. Some brains are specialized in things other than text, such as image processing or writing code, but we want to use the one that's the smartest and has an overarching view of the world: `gpt-3.5-turbo`. This is the model that the ChatGPT website uses, so it's always a good choice.\n- `messages` is an array of the JSON objects (the messages) that you want to sent to this \"brain\" of ChatGPT. The main use of having this array is to add previous responses in order to ask ChatGPT follow-up questions (e.g. \"What US state is Shelburne in?\", \"What country is that state in?\")\n- The structure of a message:\n  - `role` is the person who is saying the message. In this case, since we are sending the message, we will assume the role of `user`\n  - `content` is the actual message that you want to send to ChatGPT (*psst: This is what you type in on the ChatGPT website*)\n\n## Let's get back to coding!\n![we've got an app to code meme](https://i.imgflip.com/7t49qs.jpg)\n\nGo to `script.js` from your Replit editor and create a function. I called it `getItinerary()` but feel free to call it anything!\n\n```js\nfunction getItinerary() {\n  console.log(\"hello there!\")\n}\n```\n\n### Getting the value of our `\u003cinput/\u003e`s\nRemember the `\u003cinput/\u003e` elements that we created in `index.html`? Yeah, we need to extract the information that the user inputs into them!\n\n### Wrapping with `\u003cform/\u003e`\nTo get the value of our input elements, we need to wrap them with the `\u003cform/\u003e` element. Think of this as an element that bundles our inputs into an easy-to-manage way.\n\n```html\n \u003cform\u003e\n    \u003cinput type=\"text\" name=\"location\" /\u003e\n    \u003cinput name=\"startdate\" type=\"date\"\u003e\n    \u003cinput name=\"enddate\" type=\"date\"\u003e\n  \u003c/form\u003e\n```\n\n\u003cDropdown\ntitle=\"Hmm, we have a form, but no way to submit it?\"\n\u003e\nYes, that's correct.\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n\n**We need to add a submit button!** \n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"Is this a regular \u003cbutton/\u003e?\"\u003e\n  \n  Not really. Our browser will render it as a button, but in reality, it is another `\u003cinput/\u003e` element.\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"What? How would an \u003cinput/\u003e element be a button?\"\u003e\nYou know how all of our current input elements have a `type` attached to them? Well that's the secret behind the submit button: it's an `\u003cinput/\u003e` element with `type=\"submit\"`\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n\u003cDropdown\ntitle={`Think with your club, how could we create a button that says \"Submit\"?`}\n\u003e\n  So here is what that would look like:\n  ```html\n   \u003cinput type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\" /\u003e\n  ```\n  The `type` specifies that this input element is the button that submits the form. The `value` is the actual text that shows up on the button.\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n\n\u003cDropdown\n title=\"Where should I put this button?\"\n \u003e\nFor the form to be submitted, the button should be placed inside the `\u003cform/\u003e` tags! Our code for the form should now look like this:\n\n```html\n \u003cform\u003e\n    \u003cinput type=\"text\" name=\"location\" /\u003e\n    \u003cinput name=\"startdate\" type=\"date\"\u003e\n    \u003cinput name=\"enddate\" type=\"date\"\u003e\n    \u003cinput type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/form\u003e\n```\n\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n## Getting the values into our JavaScript code\nIf you submit the form right now, all it does is reload and clear the values from the form.\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"Why is this happening?\"\u003e\nSince we haven't told the form where/how to submit its information, it's doing nothing right now. **We can tell the form how to submit information using the `onsubmit` property**\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\nWe can add this to the opening form tag like so:\n```html\n\u003cform onsubmit=\"\"\u003e\n```\n\nIdeally, this form should be able to pass the values of our `\u003cinput/\u003e` parameters to our JavaScript code, so we can set the `onsubmit` property to the name of our function in the `script.js` file. In my case, it would look like this:\n\n```html\n\u003cform onsubmit=\"getItinerary()\"\n```\n\n\u003e *⚠️ Key tip*: Keep ALL of your HTML code below the `\u003cscript src=\"script.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e` tag for your JavaScript to run  \n\nLet's try running this and see if we get a `console.log` in the browser console!\n\nHint: Open the developer tools in Replit to see the console! It's the wrench icon right here:\n![open the wrench icon in replit to see dev tools](https://cloud-88lqktoh1-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\n---\n\n**WHAT?** That didn't work?\n\nHmm, [seems like we need to debug this out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDX02WD0og)\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"\nRiddle me this: what's the current behavior of the code right now?\n\"\u003e\nHmm, it seems like the browser is refreshing without even running the code!\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"How do you think we should go about fixing it?\"\u003e\nWe could sit here for hours trying to think of our solutions, but how about we save some time and Google it! \n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\nAfter a little searching, I found [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault). Maybe it could help us?\n\nThe form's default action is to just refresh the page, but we need to prevent that (since we need it to run our JavaScript code).\n\nThe `preventDefault()` function needs to be run from our JavaScript, and `onsubmit` is considered an event, so we can pass this event to our JS code!\n\nWe can pass the event like so:\n```html\n\u003cform onsubmit=\"getItinerary(event)\"\u003e\n```\n\nThen, in our JavaScript, we can accept the event as a function parameter:\n```js\nfunction getItinerary(event) {...}\n```\n\nThen, we can run `event.preventDefault()` to prevent the form from just refreshing the page:\n```js\nfunction getItinerary(event) {\n  event.preventDefault()\n  console.log(\"Hello there\")\n}\n```\n\nNice! We just got something in the console!\n![console.log output showing in the console](https://cloud-lx8djo7vn-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\n### We're making so much progress! Great work!\n![great work gif](https://gifdb.com/images/high/great-job-guys-jimmy-fallon-wsvujhpbhgk80bh7.gif)\n\n### Another secret in `event`\n\u003e Now, how do we actually get the values that the user types/selects in our `\u003cinput/\u003e` elements?\n\n**Through our very trusty `event` parameter!**\n\nMore specifically, we can access them under [`event.target`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/target)\n\n```js\n//ex: San Francisco\nevent.target.NAME_OF_INPUT.value\n```\n\nThe code above is an example of how we can get the value of any of our inputs.\n\nGo ahead, under the `event.preventDefault()`, add three more `console.log` calls to get the value of each `\u003cinput/\u003e` (remember to substitute the `NAME_OF_INPUT` with the actual name of the input elements. In my case, they would be something like `location`, `startdate`, and `enddate`).\n\nHere's how I did it (if you have different `\u003cinput/\u003e` names you should use those):\n```js\nfunction getItinerary(event) {\n\n  event.preventDefault()\n\n  console.log(event.target.location.value);\n  console.log(event.target.startdate.value);\n  console.log(event.target.enddate.value);\n  \n  console.log(\"Hello there\")\n}\n```\n\n**Also remember to add any additional input elements that you made at the start!**\n\nRun your code, type in your location and dates, click submit, and check in the console! This is what I got:\n![result with everything printed](https://cloud-giko7ueoa-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\n## Interacting with the ChatGPT API\nThis is going great so far! We have all the values from our input elements. Now the only thing left is to communicate with the ChatGPT API.\n\n### Calling the API with `fetch`\n![](https://media.tenor.com/h2ADJoJya-YAAAAd/playing-fetch-playing.gif)\nTo make a request to our API, we're going to be using something called `fetch`. It's a tool baked into every browser, and it enables us to send HTTP requests.\n\nHere's a general skeleton of how to use `fetch`:\n\n```js\nfetch('API_URL', {\n    method: '', //GET, POST, PUT, DELETE\n    //optional, meant for security checks (authentication)\n    headers: {\n      ...\n    },\n    //NOT needed with GET request\n    body: JSON.stringify({\n     ...\n    })\n})\n```\n\n\u003e _Break it down for me_\n\nSure!\n- `API_URL` is the first parameter of the `fetch` function. Here, we should put the URL of the API that we want to make a request to.\n- `method` is the type of HTTP request that we want to send (remember `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`?)\n- `headers` is meant for authentication data such as an API key. It basically allows us to put information so that the API can verify if we are allowed to access an endpoint! This is not always required, but the ChatGPT API requires us to add this information.\n- `body` is the body of the request (the stuff that we put inside it)\n\n**Let's add this skeleton to our code**\nCopy paste that and put it underneath all the `console.log` statements that we had. \n\n\u003e Don't mind the red squiggly lines/errors that come up, we'll resolve those! \n\u003e ![cat red error gif](https://media.tenor.com/TY8N6z1MGKsAAAAM/evil-cat-red-screen-evil-cat.gif)\n\nLet's replace a couple of those placeholder values:\n\u003cDropdown title=\"What should we replace API_URL with?\"\u003e\nWe should replace it with `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"What should we replace method with?\"\u003e\nWe should replace it with `POST`\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n\n\u003e 👋 _Psst:_ If you're a club leader, check out [`#open-ai-token`](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C05L8BSDJJ3/p1692286725598219) in the [Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack) for an alternative to the OpenAI API!\n\nLet's make some of those changes:\n```js\nfetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions', {\n    method: 'POST',\n    //optional, meant for security checks (authentication)\n    headers: {\n      ...\n    },\n    //NOT needed with GET request\n    body: JSON.stringify({\n     ...\n    })\n})\n```\n\n### What's this `headers` thing?\nWell, some APIs need to verify that we're authorized to use them. This could be because it's too expensive to run those APIs and they need some way to limit usage or keep track of who is using them.\n\nLet's add something to our diagram:\n![headers are like the labels on a package](https://cloud-27qdx0gbm-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0untitledheaders.png)\n\nYou know how the labels on a package can identify who sent the package? Likewise, request headers also identify who is sending the request.\n\nMost often, APIs use something called an **API key** to check who sent the information. They distribute these keys and each one is unique, which means that given a key, they can find out who they handed it out to.\n\n![the api developer hands out keys to each unique user](https://cloud-hqp06ld4l-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0keyexplanation.png)\n\nTo contact the ChatGPT API, we need to send these `headers` in the `fetch` request:\n```js\nheaders: {\n      'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n      'Authorization': 'Bearer OPENAI_API_KEY'\n},\n```\n\nLet's break this down:\n- `Content-Type` tells the API what kind of data the `headers` and `body` are. In this case, we are sending both in `JSON` format, so we specify that we're sending `JSON`.\n- `Authorization` is to send the API key that we have\n\n**Hmm, what API Key should I get?**\nGood observation, we need an API key. Here are the steps on how to do so:\n1. Create an account on the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)\n2. Go to the API keys page:![click the user profile and in the popup, click view api keys](https://cloud-873naq3sb-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n3. Create a new API key secret:![button to create new api key secret](https://cloud-ee2akama4-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n4. Replace `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your new API key!\n\nNow, your `fetch` request should look something like this:\n```js\nfetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions', {\n    method: 'POST',\n    //optional, meant for security checks (authentication)\n    headers: {\n      'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n      'Authorization': 'Bearer OPENAI_API_KEY'\n  },\n    //NOT needed with GET request\n    body: JSON.stringify({\n     ...\n    })\n})\n```\n\n### What should I put in `body`?\nRemember, the code that we had earlier for the request body? We need to modify that a little bit.\n\nHere's what we're starting with:\n```json\n{\n      'model': 'gpt-3.5-turbo',\n      'messages': [\n        {\n          'role': 'user',\n          'content': `What US state is Shelburne in?`\n        }\n    ],\n}\n```\n\nThe main thing we need to edit is the value in `messages`. We can keep the `role` as it is, but we need to change `content`.\n\nNow what exactly should our `content` be? Well, it has to be a prompt for ChatGPT!\n\nTake some time with your club to think of a prompt. If one of your club members is making a meal planner for your trip, their prompt should include something about food. If you have additional `\u003cinput/\u003e` elements that specify the type of trip, you should add them here.\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"How do I add \u003cinput/\u003e values in the prompt?\"\u003e\nYou can do this using [template literal strings](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_string_templates.asp)\n\nFor example, you could do something like this to add the location to your prompt (remember to use backticks for the string):\n\n```js\n'content':`plan a trip to ${event.target.location.value}`\n```\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n\nIf you need some inspiration here is what my prompt looks like:\n```js\n{\n      'model': 'gpt-3.5-turbo',\n      'messages': [\n        {\n          'role': 'user',\n          'content': `plan a trip itinerary for someone going to ${event.target.location.value} from ${event.target.startdate.value} to ${event.target.enddate.value}. have about 3 or 4 things to do per day. respond ONLY with an array that has JSON objects with the parameters \\`date\\` \\`eventTitle\\` \\`startTime\\` \\`endTime\\`\n          \\`\\`\\`\n          `\n        }\n    ],\n}\n```\n\nHere, we're asking for a response in `JSON` format so that we can parse it later on. In this array of `JSON` objects, it will have the date, title, start time, and end time of each event in our trip itinerary. It will give us about 3-4 events per day, which will be great for our users!\n\nNotice how we are asking ChatGPT to return certain values in our JSON. Think about what else we could ask it to return.\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"Here are some ideas\"\u003e\n1. The estimated cost of the trip/each event\n2. How far each event is from the previous one\n3. How long it would take to get there from the previous event\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n\u003e **Note:** I'm using `event.target.location.value`, `event.target.startdate.value`, and `event.target.enddate.value` here. If you used different values you should change these, along with the custom inputs that you added\n\n## Progress check\nYour `fetch` request should look something like this now (with your own custom prompt):\n```js\nfetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions', {\n    method: 'POST',\n    headers: {\n      'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n      'Authorization': 'Bearer OPENAI_API_KEY'\n    },\n\n    body: JSON.stringify({\n      'model': 'gpt-3.5-turbo',\n      'messages': [\n        {\n          'role': 'user',\n          'content': `plan a trip itinerary for someone going to ${event.target.location.value} from ${event.target.startdate.value} to ${event.target.enddate.value}. have about 3 or 4 things to do per day. respond ONLY with an array that has JSON objects with the parameters \\`date\\` \\`eventTitle\\` \\`startTime\\` \\`endTime\\`\n          \\`\\`\\`\n          `\n        }\n      ],\n    })\n  })\n```\n\n## Parsing the API response\nAt this point, we are making a request to the ChatGPT API, but we aren't getting its output. \n\nOur `fetch` call returns a [JavaScript promise](https://javascript.info/promise-basics), so we need to use `.then()` to get the response from the API.\n\n```js\nfetch('...',{\n...    \n).then(result =\u003e result.json()) //convert to JSON\n```\n\nOur first `.then()` **resolves** the API request and extracts what it returns. It then converts it to JSON, which contains all of the itinerary details.\n\nHowever, `result.json()` returns ***another*** promise. \n\u003cDropdown title=\"What should we do in this case?\"\u003e\nWe need to add another `.then()`!\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n\n\n```js\nfetch('...',{\n...    \n).then(result =\u003e result.json()) //convert to JSON\n .then(eventsResponse =\u003e{\n   console.log(eventsResponse)\n })\n```\n\nHere is an example of what `eventsResponse` looks like:\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"chatcmpl-7eGsZyLk57VhjL9NE5BTMB7fxLGyh\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"created\": 1689832359,\n  \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\",\n  \"choices\": [\n    {\n      \"index\": 0,\n      \"message\": {\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"content\": \"...\"\n      },\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 76,\n    \"completion_tokens\": 276,\n    \"total_tokens\": 352\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis is JSON output, and we need to get to the `content` key. We can do that with `eventsResponse.choices[0].message.content`:\n```js\nfetch('...',{\n...    \n).then(result =\u003e result.json()) //convert to JSON\n .then(eventsResponse =\u003e{\n   console.log(eventsResponse)\n   console.log(eventsResponse.choices[0].message.content)\n })\n```\n\nIf we run this and check the second `console.log`, we'll see a massive (almost cryptic) string. This is [because `content` is of type `string`, not a JavaScript Object.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=912_cPllMyg)\n\nHere's how we can convert `content` to a JS object:\n```js\nfetch('...',{\n...    \n).then(result =\u003e result.json()) //convert to JSON\n .then(eventsResponse =\u003e{\n  const events = JSON.parse(eventsResponse.choices[0].message.content)\n\n  console.log(events)\n })\n```\nNow, the variable `events` is a JavaScript object, and we can access the data that it has!\n\nIf we `console.log(events)`, it should look something like this:\n```js\n[\n  {\n    \"date\": \"2023-07-19\",\n    \"eventTitle\": \"Visit Golden Gate Bridge\",\n    \"startTime\": \"10:00\",\n    \"endTime\": \"12:00\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"date\": \"2023-07-19\",\n    \"eventTitle\": \"Explore Fisherman's Wharf\",\n    \"startTime\": \"14:00\",\n    \"endTime\": \"17:00\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"date\": \"2023-07-19\",\n    \"eventTitle\": \"Enjoy dinner at Chinatown\",\n    \"startTime\": \"18:00\",\n    \"endTime\": \"20:00\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"date\": \"2023-07-20\",\n    \"eventTitle\": \"Visit Alcatraz Island\",\n    \"startTime\": \"09:00\",\n    \"endTime\": \"12:00\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"date\": \"2023-07-20\",\n    \"eventTitle\": \"Explore the Exploratorium\",\n    \"startTime\": \"14:00\",\n    \"endTime\": \"17:00\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"date\": \"2023-07-20\",\n    \"eventTitle\": \"Watch a baseball game at AT\u0026T Park\",\n    \"startTime\": \"19:00\",\n    \"endTime\": \"22:00\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n## Adding itinerary events to the page\nThis has been going great so far! We're so close, we just need to add a couple of things.\n\nNow we need to show the itinerary on the main page. We can do this by adding a new HTML \"card\" for each event in the itinerary.\n\nGo to `index.html` again and add a `\u003cdiv\u003e` element with any `id`. This is how our JavaScript code identifies which element to add the itinerary to.\n\n\u003e Note: put this underneath the `\u003cform\u003e`\n```html\n\u003cdiv id=\"eventlist\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\n\n**Back to our JavaScript code!**\\n\nThis is what it looks like right now:\n```js\nfetch('...',{\n...    \n).then(result =\u003e result.json()) //convert to JSON\n .then(eventsResponse =\u003e{\n  const events = JSON.parse(eventsResponse.choices[0].message.content)\n\n  console.log(events)\n })\n```\n\nSince `events` is an array of JS objects, we can use a simple `for` loop to go through the array. In the loop, we can generate some HTML with the event's details in order to add it to the page.\n\nFirst, let's create a `for` loop:\n```js\nfor(const event of events){\n\n}\n```\n\nNow, `event` represents each individual event in the itinerary. Here's an example of how it looks:\n```js\n{\n    date: \"2023-07-19\",\n    eventTitle: \"Visit Golden Gate Bridge\",\n    startTime: \"10:00\",\n    endTime: \"12:00\"\n},\n```\n\nLet's edit the loop to give us back some HTML!\n```js\nfor(const event of events){\n  let htmlGenerated = `\u003cdiv\u003e\n\n      \u003ch3\u003e${event.eventTitle}\u003c/h3\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003e${new Date(event.date).toLocaleDateString(undefined, { dateStyle: \"medium\" })}\u003c/p\u003e\n\n      \u003cp\u003e${event.startTime} - ${event.endTime}\u003c/p\u003e\n\n      \u003c/div\u003e`\n}\n```\n\nLet's break some things down here:\n- We're creating a string that has HTML elements inside of it. This is sort of a \"template\"\n- Then, we can add the details of each specific event using template literals\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"What's going on with the event.date here?\"\u003e\n \nIt looks scary, I know. Let's break that down:\n- If we look at `event.date`, it looks very unreadable. Let's make it readable!\n- `.toLocalDateString()` makes our date look very pretty and readable. Here's `dateStyle:\"medium\"` shortens it (instead of `December 10th, 2023`, we get `Dec 10, 2023`)\n- The `.toLocalDateString()` function needs a `Date` object to work with\n- Since `event.date` is a `string`, we convert it to a date with `new Date()`\n\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"Remember to add anything else we requested from ChatGPT. Here are some ideas we can do with that data:\"\u003e\n1. With the estimated cost of the trip/each event, express that cost in terms of Starbucks frappucinos (for example, a $20 ticket to a museum would be 4-5 Starbucks fraps)\n2. Convert the distance from each itinerary event and express it in terms of Subway sandwiches\n3. Express the time needed to drive between destinations in terms of dog days (i.e. it would take 1 dog day to drive between Vermont and New Hampshire) \n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\nIf we `console.log` the variable `htmlGenerated` now, we should get something like this:\n```\n\u003cdiv\u003e \u003ch3\u003eCable Car Ride\u003c/h3\u003e \u003cp\u003eJul 19, 2023\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3:30 PM - 5:30 PM\u003c/p\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\nNotice how it looks like HTML? Now we need to add this to the page.\n\n**Back to the `fetch` request!**\nHere's how it's lookin' right now:\n```js\nfetch('...',{\n...    \n).then(result =\u003e result.json()) //convert to JSON\n .then(eventsResponse =\u003e{\n  const events = JSON.parse(eventsResponse.choices[0].message.content)\n  for(const event of events){\n    let htmlGenerated = `\u003cdiv\u003e\n\n      \u003ch3\u003e${event.eventTitle}\u003c/h3\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003e${new Date(event.date).toLocaleDateString(undefined, {dateStyle: \"medium\" })}\u003c/p\u003e\n\n      \u003cp\u003e${event.startTime} - ${event.endTime}\u003c/p\u003e\n\n      \u003c/div\u003e`\n  }\n })\n```\n\nNow, `htmlGenerated` needs to be added to the website.\n\n1. Let's move the `htmlGenerated` declaration outside the `for` loop like so:\n```js\nlet htmlGenerated=\"\"\n\nfor(const events of events){\n  ...\n}\n```\n2. Then, tack on each generated string to this `htmlGenerated variable` like so:\n```js\nlet htmlGenerated=\"\"\n\nfor(const events of events){\n  //add it on\n  htmlGenerated += `\u003cdiv\u003e\n\n      \u003ch3\u003e${event.eventTitle}\u003c/h3\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003e${new Date(event.date).toLocaleDateString(undefined, {dateStyle: \"medium\" })}\u003c/p\u003e\n\n      \u003cp\u003e${event.startTime} - ${event.endTime}\u003c/p\u003e\n\n      \u003c/div\u003e`\n}\n```\n\nNow that all the events are in HTML in `htmlGenerated`, we now have to shove this all inside the `\u003cdiv/\u003e` we created earlier:\n```html\n\u003cdiv id=\"eventlist\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\nUnder the `for` loop, we can add this line of code:\n```js\ndocument.getElementById(\"eventlist\").innerHTML += htmlGenerated\n```\n\nLet's break this down:\n1. We select the `\u003cdiv\u003e` from our HTML code\n2. We put our HTML of events inside the `\u003cdiv/\u003e`\n\nThis would mimic writing HTML like this, for example:\n```html\n\u003cdiv id=\"eventlist\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv\u003e \u003ch3\u003eCable Car Ride\u003c/h3\u003e \u003cp\u003eJul 19, 2023\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3:30 PM - 5:30 PM\u003c/p\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\nNotice how our event is inside the `\u003cdiv/\u003e`, which means that it will now get rendered on the page!\n\nThis is my entire `script.js` file as of now:\n```js\nfunction getItinerary(e) {\n\n    e.preventDefault()\n\n    console.log(e.target.location.value)\n\n    fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions', {\n        method: 'POST',\n        headers: {\n            'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n            'Authorization': 'Bearer OPEN_AI_API_KEY'\n        },\n\n        body: JSON.stringify({\n            'model': 'gpt-3.5-turbo',\n            'messages': [{\n                'role': 'user',\n                'content': `plan a trip itinerary for someone going to ${e.target.location.value} from ${e.target.startdate.value} to ${e.target.enddate.value}. have about 3 or 4 things to do per day. respond ONLY with an array that has JSON objects with the parameters \\`date\\` \\`eventTitle\\` \\`startTime\\` \\`endTime\\`\n          \\`\\`\\`\n          `\n            }],\n        })\n    }).then(result =\u003e result.json()).then(eventsResponse =\u003e {\n\n        const events = JSON.parse(eventsResponse.choices[0].message.content)\n        let htmlGenerated = \"\"\n        for (const event of events) {\n            //add it on\n            htmlGenerated += `\u003cdiv\u003e\n      \u003ch3\u003e${event.eventTitle}\u003c/h3\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003e${new Date(event.date).toLocaleDateString(undefined, {dateStyle: \"medium\" })}\u003c/p\u003e\n\n      \u003cp\u003e${event.startTime} - ${event.endTime}\u003c/p\u003e\n\n      \u003c/div\u003e`\n        }\n\n        document.getElementById(\"eventlist\").innerHTML = htmlGenerated\n    });\n}\n```\n\nAnd this is my `index.html` file:\n```html\n\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e\n\u003chtml\u003e\n\n\u003chead\u003e\n  \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n  \u003cmeta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width\"\u003e\n  \u003ctitle\u003ereplit\u003c/title\u003e\n  \u003clink href=\"style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" /\u003e\n\u003c/head\u003e\n\n\u003cbody\u003e\n  Hello world\n  \u003cscript src=\"script.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n\n  \u003cform onsubmit=\"getItinerary(event)\"\u003e\n    \u003cinput type=\"text\" name=\"location\" /\u003e\n    \u003cinput name=\"startdate\" type=\"date\"\u003e\n    \u003cinput name=\"enddate\" type=\"date\"\u003e\n    \u003cinput type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/form\u003e\n  \n  \u003cdiv id=\"eventlist\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/body\u003e\n\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\n## Done! 🎉\n\nNow, if you run this code, and type in some inputs, you should get a trip itinerary beautifully displayed on your screen!\n\n**Result:**\n![result](https://cloud-r7dc1z25v-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\n\n---\n\n# What next?\n\n![](https://i.giphy.com/media/KkOCoWiqwTztjUPZRR/giphy.webp)\n\nAnd now we have our club trip planned! You might be wondering what we should do now. Since we have the core functionality, you're free to take this demo home and tinker with it!\n\n**Ideas:**\nMaybe we can add some functionality to only go to Starbucks or only go to boba shops on the trip? Maybe we can make it look a bit nicer! The possibilities are endless.\n\n![you're a wizard](https://media.tenor.com/IoIn9W74-lcAAAAC/youre-a-wizard-hagrid.gif)\n\nWe hope that you've built this and came out with more knowledge about ChatGPT! \n\nNow you're truly an AI wizard 😎"

In this Jam, we'll be developing 3D models with the JavaScript library [Zdog](https://zzz.dog/#made-with-zdog). You ready? Let's go!\n\n## Outline:\n1. **Goal-setting**: Explore what we'll be doing in this workshop, and examples of 3D models _you (yes,_ you!) can create.\n2. **Set-Up**: Follow as we walk through the steps of setting up your coding environment to write code in HTML and JS.\n3. **HTML Part**: Write the HTML to prepare for creating models in JS.\n4. **JS Part**: Learn how to create shapes with Zdog and JS with a combination of code, mathematics, and art 👀\n5. **Additional Challenges**: Once you've nailed down the basics of 3D modeling with JS, check out some challenges to spice up your project 🌶️\n\nAt the end of this workshop, you will be able to make 3D models like these:\n![examples](https://cloud-5a0ya05fk.vercel.app/0large.gif)\n\nHere's a [live demo](https://repl.it/@wollygfx/Hack-Club-logo) of what we will make, you can also find the final code there.\n\n![Hack Club 3D logo](https://cloud-590c1rr82.vercel.app/0screen_recording_2020-10-21_at_7.00.53_am.gif)\n\n## Set Up\nThis workshop requires a very basic knowledge of the following languages: HTML \u0026 JS. Don’t worry if you get stuck at some point in the workshop, everything is explained the best way for you to understand!\n\nFor this workshop we will use [Repl.it](https://repl.it), click [here](https://repl.it/languages/html) to create a coding environment right for this workshop.\n\n![Setup](https://cloud-qbmylslty.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\n## HTML part\n\nAwesome, now you've got everything set up to begin coding! Now, let's begin with HTML.\n\nFirst, we want to create inside of the `\u003cbody\u003e` tag a `\u003ccanvas\u003e` in which, the 3D model we are going to create will render. Then, put a class; feel free to name it as however you want to… I will name it with the class `model`.\n\n```html\n\u003ccanvas class=\"model\"\u003e\u003c/canvas\u003e\n```\n\nNow we have to put the following code inside of the `\u003cbody\u003e` tag, this code allows us to use the Zdog library without having to download it. Learn about CDN [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network).\n\n```html\n\u003cscript src=\"https://unpkg.com/zdog@1/dist/zdog.dist.min.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n```\n\nIn the end, your code should look something like this:\n\n```html\n\u003cbody\u003e\n  \u003ccanvas class=\"model\"\u003e\u003c/canvas\u003e\n  \u003cscript src=\"https://unpkg.com/zdog@1/dist/zdog.dist.min.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n  \u003cscript src=\"script.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n\u003c/body\u003e\n```\n\n_Note: It’s very important to keep this order to make sure everything works perfectly_\n\n## JS part\nNow that we have our HTML file ready to go, we gotta work on our JavaScript file.\n\n![Cool gif](https://cloud-p49mi1lgl.vercel.app/0tumblr_e49d74c805eec46704d22c1da59ecded_cc93a056_500.gif)\n\n### Setting up the canvas\nWe are going to start with the fun part. First, let’s create the main variable and let’s give it a name. Feel free to give your variables [any name](https://sentry.io/answers/naming-variables-in-javascript/). For this tutorial, I'll use “ws”.\n\n```javascript\nconst ws = new Zdog.Illustration({\n  element: '.model',\n  resize: 'fullscreen',\n})\n```\n\nLet's break this down:\n1. **Illustration** is the top-level class that handles dealing with the `\u003ccanvas\u003e` element, holding all the shapes in the scene, and displaying those shapes in the element\n2. **element** we use this element to match the render with the canvas tag\n3. **resize** is used to modify the size in which the model will be rendered, in this case, the 3D model will render on the whole screen. If you want to, you can remove this element\n\nAt this point nothing shows up yet, so let’s create our first 3D model. \n\n### Creating the model\nNow, we’re gonna create a shape, for this workshop I want to make a simple cube, but you can create whatever you want to. Here is a list of [shapes](https://zzz.dog/shapes) you can create with Zdog.\n\n_Note: Every shape has its own properties or elements, you can check [the full list here](https://zzz.dog/shapes)._\n\nLet’s add the following code to our JS file:\n\n```javascript\nnew Zdog.Box({\n  addTo: ws,\n  width: 100,\n  height: 100,\n  depth: 100,\n  stroke: false,\n  leftFace: '#da0',\n  rightFace: '#e62',\n  topFace: '#ed0',\n  bottomFace: '#636',\n})\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. Box is a shape class, you can replace this for the shape you want to use…\n2. We made the 3D model (cube) a child to the main Zdog Illustration (ws) using the addTo element. This element must be there, otherwise the 3D model will not render.\n3. The width, height and depth elements can either stretch or shrink the shape of your box:\n    - Width: Sets the width of the cube\n    - Height: Sets the height of the cube\n    - Depth: Sets the depth of the cube. If the value is 0, the cube will render as a 2d square; so make sure to give it a value.\n\n4. The Stroke element gives the 3D model a stroke, it works as an external layer that you can use to give your 3D model a rounded look. Play around with it!\n5. leftFace, rightFace, topFace \u0026 bottomFace elements give color to each face of the 3D model, try using different colors for each face, so that you can appreciate way better the animations you make.\n\n### Rendering\nNow that we have created our 3D model, let’s render it. Use the following line of code to render the cube we just created.\n\n```javascript\nws.updateRenderGraph()\n```\n\nThis code updates and render your Zdog illustration that was declared in the first variable, so make sure to write the correct name in.\n\nNow let's click on the **Run** button to see what happens…\n\n![Render image](https://cloud-k11ck8g2n.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nCongrats, you just made your first 3D model… Yeah, maybe not what you were expecting. Let’s fix this by animating it.\n\n![woah gif](https://cloud-kr2lyxjbx.vercel.app/0woah.gif)\n\n### Animating it\nAdd the following code to our JS file:\n\n```javascript\nfunction animateModel() {\n  ws.rotate.y += 0.01\n  ws.rotate.x += 0.01\n  ws.updateRenderGraph()\n  requestAnimationFrame(animateModel)\n}\n\nanimateModel()\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. We just created a function that will make the 3D model rotate, you can name this function to whatever you want.\n2. `rotate.x` and `rotate.y` set’s the velocity to the rotation of the model:\n    - The cube will move up and down depending on the given value (- or +, respectively)\n    - The cube will move to the right and to the left depending on the given value (- or +, respectively)\n\n3. `ws.updateRenderGraph()` updates and render your Zdog illustration that was declared in the first variable, make sure to write the correct name in.\n4. `requestAnimationFrame(animatemodel)` this is like a loop, basically it makes the model rotates every time by creating frames.\n5. `animateModel()` calls the function.\n\nNow you can click on run again!\n\n![Animated model](https://cloud-djkuut7y4.vercel.app/0screen_recording_2020-10-03_at_7.31.47_pm.gif)\n\nAmazing, huh?\n\n![Amazing gif](https://cloud-hrs0t8jeh.vercel.app/0tenor.gif)\n\nNow, go ahead and experiment with the other shapes offered by Zdog (spheres, cylinders, cones, or even custom shapes) and explore the possibilities for creating your own unique 3D models!\n\n### Multiple Shapes\nIf you want to try and make more complex models you will need to use multiple shapes, [here](https://zzz.dog/#made-with-zdog) are some examples of what you can create:\n\n![examples](https://cloud-2jaw6a14x.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nMaking multiple shapes is very easy, it’s as simple as putting multiple shapes together until you get what you want. The hardest part of this is to put everything where it must be, we can do this using the property: “translate”. \n\nYou can use this property by creating your own complex illustration, which explores hierarchical structures, grouping shapes, and experimenting with positioning and transformations. We'll see how this works when creating a Hack Club logo! Click [here](https://repl.it/@wollygfx/Hack-Club-logo) to see the final code.\n\nFirst, let's change the class of our canvas in the `index.html` file from `model` to `hackclub`.\n\n```html\n...\n\u003ccanvas class=\"hackclub\"\u003e\u003c/canvas\u003e\n...\n```\n\nAnd add a background color for our project in the `style.css` file. You can choose any color for the background of your 3D model using [a library of hex codes](https://www.color-hex.com/).\n\n```css\n.hackclub {\n  background: #FDB;\n}\n```\n\nAfter that, let's go back to the `script.js` file and change the `element` selected by Zdog from `.template` to `.hackclub` and add the `dragRotate` property with the value set to `true` so we can rotate our creation.\n\n```js\nconst ws = new Zdog.Illustration({\n  element: '.hackclub',\n  resize: 'fullscreen',\n  dragRotate: true\n})\n```\n\nNext, let's change the properties of our cube so that it turns into a square:\n\n```javascript\nnew Zdog.Box({\n  addTo: ws,\n  width: 100,\n  height: 100,\n  color: '#ec3750',\n  stroke: 20,\n  translate: { z: -18 },\n})\n```\n\n1. As seen before, the `addTo` property puts the made shape inside of the main Zdog Illustration.\n2. Used the width and height properties to make a perfect square, i didn't give it a depth because it was not needed.\n3. The whole square will have the same color (red), so we can use the color property to give the whole shape a single color instead of assigning a color to each face.\n4. As mentioned before, the stroke property helps the shape to look a little rounded.\n5. The translate property moves the square -18 within the z-axis. You can interpret this as if you were giving a shape a depth, so the shape is moved backwards.\n\nNow I will create the letter 'H', so I'm gonna need 3 more boxes:\n\n```javascript\nnew Zdog.Box({\n  addTo: ws,\n  depth: 20,\n  width: 20,\n  height: 80,\n  color: '#fff',\n  translate: { z: 18, x: -20 },\n})\n```\n\n- This time, the shape is moved forward… This creates an space between the red square and this new shape.\n- The shape is moved to the left within the x-axis\n\n![result 1](https://cloud-kg0xtr3hs.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\n```javascript\nnew Zdog.Box({\n  addTo: ws,\n  depth: 20,\n  width: 20,\n  height: 40,\n  color: '#fff',\n  translate: { z: 18, y: 20, x: 20 },\n})\n```\n\n- This time, we created a new box but way smaller.\n- We moved it to the right within x-axis and a little bit down within the y-axis.\n\n![result 2](https://cloud-1nisp19i8.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\n```javascript\nnew Zdog.Box({\n  addTo: ws,\n  depth: 20,\n  width: 40,\n  height: 20,\n  color: '#fff',\n  translate: { z: 18, x: 10 },\n})\n```\n\nIn this last one, all we had to do was to move the box to the right within the x-axis, so that it blends with the box in the right.\n\n![result 3](https://cloud-m2gpkvlqa.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nNow let's update the animation function with some simple properties:\n\n```javascript\nfunction animateModel() {\n  ws.rotate.y += 0.01\n  ws.updateRenderGraph()\n  requestAnimationFrame(animateModel)\n}\n\nanimateModel()\n```\n\nHere's the final result:\n\n![final result](https://cloud-d9lxnrldx.vercel.app/0screen_recording_2020-10-09_at_12.05.02_pm.gif)\n\n### Level up\nCongratulations! You just learned the basics of Zdog, feel free to check the resources below to improve your knowledge...\n\n![Congrats gif](https://cloud-d0aqa4icc.vercel.app/0bec38a05d56ac6ae2d9dec2f482ebff9.gif)\n\nMake your own 3D Model and share it in the [Hack Club Slack](https://hackclub.slack.com), I would love to see what you can create using what you've learned in this workshop!\n\nNow that you know the basics, you may be wondering where to go from here. Well, look no further, I've left a list of challenges for you to spice up your project and become a 3D modeling expert!\n\n🌶️ __MILD:__\n- Interactive Animation:\n\t- Research Zdog's event handlers, such as 'onDrag' or 'onClick', to capture user input.\n\t- Use event listers to detect mouse or touch events and modify properties of your 3D model accordingly.\n\t- Look through Zdog's GitHub repository and CodePen to see examples of interactive Zdog projects.\n- Creating Complex Compositions\n\t- Plan out your compositions in advance with a pen/paper or digital design tool (I recommend Procreate or Krita).\n\t- Experiment with positioning, rotation, and scaling properties until you reach your desired outcome.\n\t- Review Zdog's group property and explore ways to use it for managing multiple shapes together.\n\n🌶️ 🌶️ __MEDIUM:__\n- Camera Movement:\n\t- Look at Zdog examples and tutorials that showcase camera manipulation to learn different approaches and techniques.\n- Lighting and Shading: \n\t- Research libraries and frameworks with advanced rendering capabilities, such as [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) or [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/), which offer support for materials, textures, and opacity.transparency effects in 3D rendering.\n\t- You can also achieve the effect of different opacities by experimenting with color theory, changing the colors of surfaces and the backdrop, and more!\n\n🌶️ 🌶️ 🌶️ __HOT:__\n- Advanced Interactions:\n\t- Create advanced interactions by using libraries and frameworks in tandem with Zdog.\n\t\t- [React.js](https://react.dev/) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), which are used for creating user interfaces, can be used to create complex and interactive scenes using event handling and component lifecycle management \n\t\t- Interactive SVG libraries like [Snap.svg](http://snapsvg.io/), or Canvas libraries like [Paper.js](http://paperjs.org/about/) can create complex interactions, animations, and event handling capabilities.\n\n\n### Other examples\nCheck out these cool 3D models made by other people:\n\n- [Live digital clock made using Zdog](https://codepen.io/jh3y/pen/vqYLKd)\n- [Amethyst from Steven Universe made using Zdog](https://codepen.io/Metahari/pen/dEQMBy)\n- [Octocat made using Zdog](https://codepen.io/defunty/pen/vwwjPL)\n\n### Resources\n- [Zdog website](https://zzz.dog)\n- [Made with Zdog](https://codepen.io/collection/DzdGMe/?cursor=ZD0xJm89MSZwPTEmdj0z)\n- [Text plugin for Zdog](https://jaames.github.io/zfont/)\n- [Plotting data with Zdogs](https://observablehq.com/@zechasault/images-drawn-with-zdogs)"

One group could focus on designing the app, another could focus on the front end, and another could focus on the back end.\n\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n\n#### Pre-requisites\n\nIdeally, you have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but if this is your first jam, feel free to ask for help!\n\n## Brainstorming\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"Brain Fact!\"\u003e\nThe human brain weighs 3 pounds\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\nThe foundation of any social media app is creating and loading some sort of post. Think of any popular social media (Instagram, Reddit, YouTube, or even a recipe app). Share your ideas with the club!\n\n## Setting up\n\nPlease fork/clone [this Repl.it boilerplate](https://replit.com/@JadenHou1/JAM) to get started! We'll go over the files in a sec.\n\n```\nindex.html\nlogin.html\n```\n\nThese are the two pages we'll be using for our app. `index.html` is the home page where we'll load all the posts and login, and `create.html` is the page where users can create posts.\n\nOn each page, we have a basic HTML boilerplate with script and style tags. Conventionally, you'd have these in other files and link them to the HTML file, but for simplicity, we'll just keep them in the same file.\n\n### Creating a Firebase account\n\nHead over to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/) and log in with Google. Once you're in, create a new project and name it whatever you want.\n\nThen, click and enable `Authentication` and `Firestore Database`.\n![Console](https://cloud-5uj5nkwmd-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image-1.png)\n\n**Authentication**\n\n1. Click `Get Started`\n2. Click `Sign-in method` and enable `Google`\n3. Enable and save\n\nIf you're using Replit, add your domain by going into Settings \u003e Authorized Domains and add your project's domain. If you don't add the domain (localhost is already added), the authentication pop-up will close instantly.\n\n**Firestore**\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"Shark Fact!\"\u003e\nSharks...do not have bones\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n1. Click `Start in test mode`\n2. Click `Next` and choose `nam5` as the location\n\n### Creating an app in Firebase\n\n![Console](https://cloud-aal2o35z9-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image-3.png)\n\n1. Click the `\u003c/\u003e` icon\n2. Name your app anything\n3. Click `Use a \u003cscript\u003e tag`\n4. Keep this code snippet on hand, we'll need it later\n\nHere is what the code snippet looks like and what each line does:\n\n```html\n\u003cscript type=\"module\"\u003e\n    import { initializeApp } from \"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/10.0.0/firebase-app.js\"; // imports the initializeApp function from the Firebase SDK\n    const firebaseConfig = {\n        apiKey: \"AIzaSyBdD6AmLOxx0b7MPc9FggPMYpttLq-XEE4\",\n        authDomain: \"jammer-7b6da.firebaseapp.com\",\n        projectId: \"jammer-7b6da\",\n        storageBucket: \"jammer-7b6da.appspot.com\",\n        messagingSenderId: \"789182152948\",\n        appId: \"1:789182152948:web:380ac8c7beb26882569ea1\",\n    }; // specific details unique to your web app. This lets Firebase know that you want to access your services and not someone else's\n    const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig); // load the Firebase app\n\u003c/script\u003e\n```\n\n\u003e Use your own code snippet! This code snippet won't work for you.\n\n## Logging in\n\n![Logs](https://cloud-aal2o35z9-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1image-4.png)\n\nHead over to `index.html`. Firebase makes it super easy to add user authentication to your app. We'll be using Google Sign-In, but you can use any of the other methods Firebase provides.\n\nFirst, create a button with `Sign in with Google`. We'll use the id `login` to add an event listener.\n\n```html\n\u003cbutton id=\"login\"\u003eSign in with Google\u003c/button\u003e\n```\n\nFirebase gives us a really useful `signInWithPopup` and `GoogleAuthProvider` to handle user authentication.\n\nFirst, add your **Firebase code snippet** from before to the script tag.\n\nThen, import these Firebase functions. This lets us use pre-written functions in our code. Specifically, we want to use `getAuth` to load the authentication, `signInWithPopup` to prompt the user with a popup to log in, and `GoogleAuthProvider` to tell Firebase that we want to use Google.\n\n```js\nimport {\n    getAuth,\n    signInWithPopup,\n    GoogleAuthProvider,\n} from \"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/10.0.0/firebase-auth.js\";\n```\n\nInitialize `getAuth` and the `GoogleAuthProvider`.\n\n```js\nconst auth = getAuth();\nconst provider = new GoogleAuthProvider();\n```\n\nNow, we can add an event listener to the `login` button. Try making it so that when the user clicks the button, we call `signInWithPopup`.\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"Solution!\"\u003e\n\n```js\ndocument.getElementById(\"login\").addEventListener(\"click\", () =\u003e {\n    signInWithPopup(auth, provider).then(() =\u003e {\n        window.location.replace(\"/\"); // redirect to home page after logged in\n    });\n});\n```\n\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"Your HTML Body should look something like this when finished.\"\u003e\n\n```html\n\u003cbutton id=\"login\"\u003eSign in with Google\u003c/button\u003e\n\u003cscript type=\"module\"\u003e\n    import { initializeApp } from \"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/10.0.0/firebase-app.js\";\n    import {\n        getAuth,\n        signInWithPopup,\n        GoogleAuthProvider,\n    } from \"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/10.0.0/firebase-auth.js\";\n    const firebaseConfig = {\n        apiKey: \"AIzaSyBdD6AmLOxx0b7MPc9FggPMYpttLq-XEE4\",\n        authDomain: \"jammer-7b6da.firebaseapp.com\",\n        projectId: \"jammer-7b6da\",\n        storageBucket: \"jammer-7b6da.appspot.com\",\n        messagingSenderId: \"789182152948\",\n        appId: \"1:789182152948:web:380ac8c7beb26882569ea1\",\n    };\n    const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);\n    const auth = getAuth();\n    const provider = new GoogleAuthProvider();\n\n    const login = document.getElementById(\"login\");\n    login.addEventListener(\"click\", () =\u003e {\n        signInWithPopup(auth, provider).then(() =\u003e\n            window.location.replace(\"/\")\n        );\n    });\n\u003c/script\u003e\n```\n\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n![Login button](https://cloud-aal2o35z9-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/7image-5.png)\nTest it out! You should receive a prompt to login. \u003csmall\u003e[Need help?](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/google-signin)\u003c/small\u003e\n\n## Creating a post\n\n![Alt text](https://cloud-aal2o35z9-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/3image-7.png)\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"Whale Fact!\"\u003e\nWhales can get SUNBURNS\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\nHead over to `create.html`. This is where we'll let users create posts. I'll have to leave these fields up to you, but I'll give you a starting point. Please add fields that are relevant to your idea!\n\n**From now on, your code will depend on the idea you came up with.** For me, I'm going with your average dog personality-sharing app.\n\nFirst, create a form for users to enter their information.\n\n```html\n\u003cform id=\"form\"\u003e\n    \u003cinput id=\"name\" type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Name\" /\u003e\n    \u003cinput id=\"description\" type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Description\" /\u003e\n    \u003cbutton type=\"submit\"\u003eSubmit\u003c/button\u003e\n\u003c/form\u003e\n```\n\n\u003e The fields `name` and `description` can be anything you want. Add fields that make sense for your app! For example, a recipe app may have an estimated time to make, and a club directory app may have meeting times.\n\nThis is just a basic form with 2 inputs and a submit button. Adding IDs to each input allows us to access the values on submit. Adding an ID to the form allows us to add an event listener to it.\n\nTo add these fields to the database, we have to import some new packages! First, add the **Firebase code snippet** from before to the `\u003cscript\u003e`. Then, import both the **authentication functions from before** and the `getFirestore`, `setDoc`, and `doc` functions from **Firestore** as follows.\n\n```js\nimport {\n    getAuth,\n    signInWithPopup,\n    GoogleAuthProvider,\n} from \"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/10.0.0/firebase-auth.js\";\nimport {\n    getFirestore,\n    addDoc,\n    doc,\n} from \"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/10.0.0/firebase-firestore.js\";\n```\n\nImporting `getFirestore`, `addDoc`, and `doc` allows us to load Firestore, add documents to the database, and reference a document in the database, respectively.\n\nLoad each package.\n\n```js\nconst auth = getAuth();\nconst db = getFirestore();\n```\n\nThen, access the form element, and add an event listener to listen for form submissions.\n\n```js\nform.addEventListener(\"submit\", (e) =\u003e {\n    e.preventDefault();\n});\n```\n\nBy default, forms will refresh the page on submit. We don't want this because we won't be able to execute code if the page is refreshing, so we'll add `e.preventDefault()` to prevent the page from refreshing.\n\nWe don't want just anyone to add posts, just users! So, we'll add a check to see if the user is logged in. If they are, we'll add the post to the database. If not, we'll alert them to log in.\n\nAdd the following after the `e.preventDefault()`.\n\nIf I can get the current user by using `auth.currentUser`, how would I check if there is no current user?\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"Solution!\"\u003e\n\n```js\nconst currentUser = auth.currentUser;\nif (!currentUser) {\n    alert(\"Please login first\");\n    return;\n}\n```\n\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n`auth.currentUser` lets us access the current user. If there is no current user, the variable will be `null`, so we can alert the user and not add anything. `return` will stop the function from executing any more code.\n\nThen, create a collection in Firestore. A collection holds all your documents. It's like a bucket for all your data.\n![Alt text](https://cloud-aal2o35z9-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/4image-8.png)\n![Alt text](https://cloud-aal2o35z9-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/5image-9.png)\n\n\u003e Choose a collection name that makes sense for your app! It doesn't have to be posts if that doesn't make sense. Maybe something like `recipes` or `clubs` would make more sense for your idea\n\nWhen you're prompted to create the first document, add sample data for the fields you've already created above. You can just click auto-ID for the document ID.\n_For example, in my case I'll add `name` and `description`._\n![Alt text](https://cloud-aal2o35z9-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/6image-10.png)\n\nNow, we can access the values of each input and add them to the database. We'll use `addDoc` to add a document to the database. `addDoc` takes in 2 parameters: the reference to the collection and the data to add. We'll use `collection` to reference the collection we want to add to, `name.value` to get the value of the first input, and `description.value` to get the value of the second input. We can also use `currentUser.displayName` to grab the name of the author to display.\n\n```js\nconst form = document.getElementById(\"form\");\nconst name = document.getElementById(\"name\");\nconst description = document.getElementById(\"description\");\naddDoc(collection(db, \"posts\"), {\n    name: name.value,\n    description: description.value,\n    author: currentUser.displayName,\n});\n```\n\n\u003e Your `name` and `description` variables will vary based on the fields you set. Be sure to change them to match this format: `const \u003cfield\u003e = document.getElementById(\"\u003cfield\u003e\")`. Also, the key/values in the data we're adding will vary.\n\nFinally, we'll let the user know that they've successfully submitted a post.\n\n```js\nalert(\"Successfully submitted post!\");\n```\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"Your HTML Body should look something like this when finished.\"\u003e\n\n```html\n\u003cform id=\"form\"\u003e\n    \u003cinput id=\"name\" type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Name\" /\u003e\n    \u003cinput id=\"description\" type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Description\" /\u003e\n    \u003cbutton type=\"submit\"\u003eSubmit\u003c/button\u003e\n\u003c/form\u003e\n\u003cscript type=\"module\"\u003e\n    import { initializeApp } from \"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/10.0.0/firebase-app.js\";\n    import {\n        getAuth,\n        signInWithPopup,\n        GoogleAuthProvider,\n    } from \"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/10.0.0/firebase-auth.js\";\n    import {\n        getFirestore,\n        addDoc,\n        collection,\n    } from \"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/10.0.0/firebase-firestore.js\";\n    const firebaseConfig = {\n        apiKey: \"AIzaSyBdD6AmLOxx0b7MPc9FggPMYpttLq-XEE4\",\n        authDomain: \"jammer-7b6da.firebaseapp.com\",\n        projectId: \"jammer-7b6da\",\n        storageBucket: \"jammer-7b6da.appspot.com\",\n        messagingSenderId: \"789182152948\",\n        appId: \"1:789182152948:web:380ac8c7beb26882569ea1\",\n    };\n    const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);\n    const auth = getAuth();\n    const db = getFirestore();\n    const form = document.getElementById(\"form\");\n    form.addEventListener(\"submit\", (e) =\u003e {\n        e.preventDefault();\n        const currentUser = auth.currentUser;\n        if (!currentUser) {\n            alert(\"Please login first\");\n            return;\n        }\n        const name = document.getElementById(\"name\").value;\n        const description = document.getElementById(\"description\").value;\n        addDoc(collection(db, \"posts\"), {\n            name: name,\n            description: description,\n            author: currentUser.displayName,\n        });\n        alert(\"Successfully submitted post!\");\n    });\n\u003c/script\u003e\n```\n\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n## Loading posts\n\nThis is where it gets good. We'll be loading posts from the database and displaying them on the home page. Head over to `index.html`.\n\n\u003e I'll leave this implementation up to you, but I'll give you some steps to get started.\n\nAfter the code from the login, import the Firestore from before into the file.\n\n```js\n// snippet\n\nimport {\n    getFirestore,\n    getDocs,\n    collection,\n} from \"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/10.0.0/firebase-firestore.js\";\nconst db = getFirestore();\n```\n\nTo create an element for each post, we'll need to get each post and run a function for each. We'll need `getDocs`. `getDocs` returns a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Promises#async_and_await), and we can use `await` to turn that into a value, but we won't get into that in this jam (think of it as a black box).\n\nHere's an example of how to use `getDocs` to get all the posts.\n\n```js\nconst posts = await getDocs(collection(db, \"posts\"));\n```\n\nNow, we can use [`.forEach`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach) to [create elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement).\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"Solution!\"\u003e\n\n```js\nconst db = getFirestore();\nconst div = document.getElementById(\"div\");\nconst posts = await getDocs(collection(db, \"posts\"));\nposts.forEach((doc) =\u003e {\n    const element = document.createElement(\"div\");\n    const name = document.createElement(\"h1\");\n    name.innerText =\n        doc.data().name +\n        \" • \" +\n        doc.data().author;\n    element.appendChild(name);\n    const description = document.createElement(\"p\");\n    idea.innerText = doc.data().description;\n    element.appendChild(idea);\n    div.appendChild(element);\n});\n```\n\n\u003e Your code will look different depending on your fields\n\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\nThat's it! Now you have a working social media app. It's your job to add CSS, more fields, and more features to make it your own.\n\n## Not-so-full list of customizations\n - Change the styling\n - Change how posts are loaded\n - Change fields\n - Add cosmetic elements\n"

                  "content": "\nConverting words to colors is a difficult concept to wrap your head around when you first think about it, but that’s exactly what you’re going to do in this workshop. In just 20 lines of code, you’re going to build a website that allows you to type all over the screen and watch the color of your screen change based on the number of verbs, nouns, adjectives, and adverbs in the text.\n\n[**Link to demo**](https://colorful-grammar.techbug2012.repl.co/)\n[**Link to demo code**](https://repl.it/@TechBug2012/colorful-grammar)\n\n## Getting started\n\nCreate a new Repl.it project at [replit.com/languages/html](https://replit.com/languages/html).\n\nTo make things a little easier for us, we’re going to be using [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), a popular JavaScript library that simplifies writing certain common JavaScript tasks. You’ll get to see how jQuery can be really useful throughout this workshop.\n\nWe’re also going to use [WordPOS](https://github.com/moos/wordpos), a cool dictionary library that identifies the grammar type of a given word (e.g. noun, verb, etc).\n\nLet’s start by importing these two libraries. Just before the end of the `\u003chead\u003e` tag of your `index.html` file, add these two lines:\n\n```html\n\u003cscript src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.min.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n\u003cscript src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/wordpos-web@1.0.2/dist/wordpos.min.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n```\n## Typing on the screen\n\nGreat! Now that we’ve imported the libraries we need to make our website, it’s time to write some code.\n\nIn order to use our entire screen as our canvas for writing, we need to create a `\u003ctextarea\u003e` in our HTML file and use CSS to make it fill the entire screen.\n\nIn the `\u003cbody\u003e` of your `index.html` file, under the line where `script.js` is imported, add this line:\n\n```html\n\u003ctextarea id=\"sentence\" autofocus\u003e\u003c/textarea\u003e\n```\n\nThis creates a [textarea](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_textarea.asp) element with the id “sentence”, and automatically focuses on it so that you don’t have to click on it to start typing. If you run your repl, you’ll see this textarea in the top left corner.\n\nIn order to be able to use this textarea as our writing canvas, we’ll need to do some CSS work. Namely:\n\n1. Remove the white background\n2. Remove the blue outline around the edges\n3. Remove the black border around the edges\n4. Make it fill the entire screen without overflowing\n\nStart by adding\n\n```css\ntextarea {\n}\n```\n\nto your `style.css` file.\n\nTo remove the white background, we use `background: none;`. To remove the blue outline, we use `outline: 0;`. To remove the black border, we use `border: 0;`. Add these three [declarations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Syntax) inside the `textarea` [block](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Syntax) of your `style.css` file. When you’re done, the file should look like this:\n\n```css\ntextarea {\n  background: none;\n  outline: 0;\n  border: 0;\n}\n```\n\nWhen you run your repl, you should see that the textarea appears to have disappeared. But if you click at the top left corner of the preview, you’ll notice that you can still type. The textarea is still there—you’ve just made it invisible.\n\nWe still need to make the textarea fill the whole screen. Add `width: 100%;` and `height: 100%;` to the `textarea` block in your `style.css` file. While you’re at it, go ahead and also add `font-size: 48px`, which makes the font size bigger.\n\n```css\ntextarea {\n  background: none;\n  outline: 0;\n  border: 0;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n  font-size: 48px;\n}\n```\n\nYour textarea still doesn’t quite fill the whole screen, though—these two properties only made it fill 100% of its parent element. In our case, this is the `\u003cbody\u003e`, which doesn’t fill the whole screen. We ran into the same problem in the [Splatter Paint Workshop](https://github.com/hackclub/hackclub/blob/main/workshops/colorful_grammar)—check it out for a clearer explanation of this concept.\n\nTo make the `\u003cbody\u003e` fill the whole screen, simply add\n\n```css\nhtml,\nbody {\n  height: 100%;\n}\n```\n\nto your `style.css` file.\n\nWhen you run your repl, you’ll notice that the textarea fills the whole screen! But if you type too much, it’ll shift a little bit to the right, obscuring some of the text. We can fix this by adding `padding: 0;` to the `textarea` block.\n\nNow the textarea fills the whole screen without overflowing!\n\nJust to recap—this is what your entire `style.css` file should now look like:\n\n```css\nhtml,\nbody {\n  height: 100%;\n}\n\ntextarea {\n  background: none;\n  outline: 0;\n  border: 0;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n  font-size: 48px;\n  padding: 0;\n}\n```\n\n## Coloring our canvas\n\nNow that we can write anywhere on our screen, it’s time to make use of the libraries we imported earlier.\n\nNavigate to your `script.js` file and add the following:\n\n```js\nconst wordpos = new WordPOS({\n  dictPath: 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/wordpos-web@1.0.2/dict'\n})\n```\n\nThis initializes a new instance of the WordPOS library with a dictionary to identify words with.\n\nUnder this, add\n\n```js\n$(document).ready(function () {})\n```\n\nThis is how jQuery is initialized. Usually when you see a dollar sign in JavaScript, it’s a shorthand for jQuery.\n\nNow, let’s write a function that updates the background of our page inside the jQuery function.\n\n```js\n$(document).ready(function () {\n  function updateBackground() {}\n})\n```\n\nInside the `updateBackground` function, add the line:\n\n```js\nlet sentence = $('#sentence').val()\n```\n\nThis uses jQuery to get the value of our textarea, which if you recall, we gave the id “sentence”. You could replace `$(“#sentence”)` with `document.getElementById(“sentence”)`, but the jQuery syntax makes it a little bit easier.\n\nTo get the number of each type of word used in the sentence, we need yet another function. Add the following inside the `updateBackground` function:\n\n```js\nwordpos.getPOS(sentence).then(function (types) {})\n```\n\nAs of now, this is what your `script.js` file should look like:\n\n```js\nconst wordpos = new WordPOS({\n  dictPath: 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/wordpos-web@1.0.2/dict'\n})\n\n$(document).ready(function () {\n  function updateBackground() {\n    wordpos.getPOS(sentence).then(function (types) {})\n  }\n})\n```\n\n## Converting text to a color\n\nThe beauty of this workshop is that there are endless ways you can go about creating a color from all of this data, and each will produce a different result. I’m going to show what I personally came up with, but as you read the next steps, be actively thinking of ways you can change it to do something different.\n\nWe’re going to be creating our color with the [HSL (Hue, Saturation, Luminosity) color system](http://thenewcode.com/61/An-Easy-Guide-To-HSL-Color). If you’re not familiar with it, all you need to understand for this demo is that the HSL system uses a color wheel, and you identify a color according to its position on the color wheel in degrees. Also important to note is that colors start a new cycle once you pass 360°. Just like a 60° angle looks the same as a 420 (360 + 60)° angle, 60° on the HSL color system is the same color as 420°: yellow.\n\n[![Color wheel divided into 6 equal parts](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/2550f89160b7c53a6f846c1206c6ba20763f93f2546e981c250c191a48c6935d/68747470733a2f2f636c6f75642d707670766b706575632d6861636b2d636c75622d626f742e76657263656c2e6170702f3168736c2d636f6c6f722d776865656c2e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/2550f89160b7c53a6f846c1206c6ba20763f93f2546e981c250c191a48c6935d/68747470733a2f2f636c6f75642d707670766b706575632d6861636b2d636c75622d626f742e76657263656c2e6170702f3168736c2d636f6c6f722d776865656c2e706e67)\n\nBecause we can simply identify a color with a number, one way we can process our data is by adding up the frequency of each type of word. Using the WordPOS library, getting the total number of word type is as simple as `types.[type].length`; for example, `types.verbs.length`.\n\nCreate a variable that adds up the frequency of every type of word.\n\n```js\nvar color =\n  types.verbs.length +\n  types.adverbs.length +\n  types.nouns.length +\n  types.adjectives.length +\n  types.rest.length\n```\n\nNow that we have a number that we can create an HSL color with, let’s create it and change the background color. This is where jQuery becomes really useful: we’re going to change the CSS on our page right from our JavaScript file!\n\n```js\n$('body').css('background-color', `hsl(${color}, 100%, 50%)`)\n```\n\n(Note: in JavaScript, you can use back-ticks instead of quotation marks and concatenate strings using the `${variable}` syntax. The dollar sign next to `hsl` is unrelated to jQuery. Learn more about this syntax [here](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/01/ES6-Template-Strings).)\n\nHere’s what your entire `script.js` file should look like after this:\n\n```js\nconst wordpos = new WordPOS({\n  dictPath: 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/wordpos-web@1.0.2/dict'\n})\n\n$(document).ready(function () {\n  function updateBackground() {\n    let sentence = $('#sentence').val()\n\n    wordpos.getPOS(sentence).then(function (types) {\n      var color =\n        types.verbs.length +\n        types.adverbs.length +\n        types.nouns.length +\n        types.adjectives.length +\n        types.rest.length\n\n      $('body').css('background-color', `hsl(${color}, 100%, 50%)`)\n    })\n  }\n})\n```\n\nWe’re almost done! The final step is to run the `updateBackground()` function once when the page loads and then each time a new letter is typed.\n\nRight before the last closing curly brace, add these two lines:\n\n```js\nupdateBackground()\n$('#sentence').on('keydown', updateBackground)\n```\n\nNow, your `script.js` file should look like this:\n\n```js\nconst wordpos = new WordPOS({\n  dictPath: 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/wordpos-web@1.0.2/dict'\n})\n\n$(document).ready(function () {\n  function updateBackground() {\n    let sentence = $('#sentence').val()\n\n    wordpos.getPOS(sentence).then(function (types) {\n      var color =\n        types.verbs.length +\n        types.adverbs.length +\n        types.nouns.length +\n        types.adjectives.length +\n        types.rest.length\n\n      $('body').css('background-color', `hsl(${color}, 100%, 50%)`)\n    })\n  }\n  updateBackground()\n  $('#sentence').on('keydown', updateBackground)\n})\n```\n\nWhen you run your repl, you should be greeted by a blank red screen. Click on the preview and start typing a bunch of words. You should see the background color change as you type each word!\n\n## Hacking\n\nYour journey is far from over. There are endless ways you can make this your own. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. If you feel like the background color is changing too slowly, try multiplying your `color` variable by a number so that it goes around the HSL color wheel more quickly.\n2. Why make your background only one color? How about using the CSS [linear-gradient](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/linear-gradient) function? [Check out what I did](https://repl.it/@TechBug2012/colorful-grammar) for an example of what this looks like. There are many, many different ways you can make a gradient!\n3. I kept the saturation and luminosity of my color at 100% and 50%, but that doesn’t mean you have to! Try changing those numbers around and see how many new colors you can create.\n4. Change the font and size of the text in the textarea\n\n...and much, much more!\n\nYour new task is to hack away at this project until it looks noticeably different from this demo and is totally your own. Go crazy, and good luck!\n"

Hot cocoa, pine trees, family tradition, sledding, and, most importantly, snow, are all favourites from this cozy season. However, winter doesn't last forever, and snow melts, much to the dismay of every five-year-old with a snowman. But, we humans have made a solution... snowglobes!\n\n![https://cloud-fcssxnb6l-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/](https://cloud-fcssxnb6l-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/6snow_doge.png)]\n\nSo much snow in a small sphere?!? What much more could a person want?\n\n![https://cloud-fcssxnb6l-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/](https://cloud-fcssxnb6l-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/7power_graph.png)\n\u003e It's scientifically proven!\n\nSo, how would you like to create your own, virtual, shareable snowglobe? (I guess you don't have a choice at this point because, spoiler alert, you are doing that right about now...)\n\n## What We're Making\n\n![https://cloud-782rtf1du-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0ezgif.com-resize.gif](https://cloud-782rtf1du-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0ezgif.com-resize.gif)\n\nIn this jam, we'll be making a custom, digital snowglobe (as implied by the title!) You'll be able to choose the background, particles, or even the music. [Here's a live demo of what we're building.](https://snowglobe.judahbrown.dev/)\n\n# The Basics\n\n\u003e If you'd like to skip ahead to the fun part, or if you're short on time, you can use [this template on replit to get started!](https://replit.com/@VelocityDev/snowglobe-template) Just hit the \"use template\" button at the top of the page and skip ahead to the \"Make it look Fabulous\" section (note: the particles.json file is already in place.) This template comes with the 'Make it Installable' customization already added as well.\n\n## Setting the Page Up\nEvery good project starts with a plan! Here, we'll link to some essential libraries and lay out the page. We'll be using basic HTML, intermediate CSS, and more advanced JavaScript, but it's really easy to figure out!\n\n\u003e [For a video on some HTML basics, click here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salY_Sm6mv4)\n\n### 🦴 Add the Skeleton\nWhile some skeletons are spooky-scary, these skeletons are actually really useful! A page skeleton is just the basic HTML that every website should have, such as a `\u003c!DOCTYPE\u003e`, `\u003chtml\u003e` tags, and a `\u003chead\u003e`/`\u003cbody\u003e`.\n\n\u003e For more information on the basics of an HTML page, watch (LINK TO BE ADDED)\n\n### ⛓ Linking Libraries\nNow, to link the `tsParticles` library.\ntsParticles is available as a single file from JSDeliver. Link to it using a `\u003cscript\u003e`  tag at `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tsparticles@2.11.0/tsparticles.bundle.min.js`.\n\n### Lay it all Out\nTo lay out our page, we'll be using `div`'s (inside of the `\u003cbody\u003e` tag) which allow us to split the page into separate areas. They can be nested inside of each other and stylized with CSS. Let's make a `snowglobe` div with sections `particles` and `ground`...\n\n```html\n...\n\u003cdiv id=\"snowglobe\"\u003e\n\t\u003cdiv id=\"particles\"\u003e\n\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\u003cdiv id=\"ground\"\u003e\n\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n...\n```\n\nWe'll leave these `div`'s empty, but they'll serve an important role in laying out our page.\n\n### 🖌 Make it look ✨ fabulous ✨\nCSS is a language that allows us to style HTML pages! With it, we can resize elements, change fonts, mess with colors, and even animate things!\n\nTo start, let's reset all of the spacing!\n\n```css\n* {\n\tpadding: 0;\n\tmargin: 0;\n}\n```\n\nNext, we'll set up flex display on body. Make sure to set its `flex-direction` to `column`. Additionally, we'll make the body fill the whole viewport, set its background color (feel free to change this! this is the page background, not the snowglobe background), and make it center all the items with `justify-content` and `align-items`.\n\n```css\nbody {\n\t/* Set up flex display */\n\tdisplay: flex;\n\tflex-direction: column;\n\t\n\t/* Fill the whole viewport */\n\twidth: 100vw;\n\theight: 100vh;\n\toverflow: hidden; /* Hide all overflow */\n\t\n\t/* Center the items */\n\tjustify-content: center;\n\talign-items: center;\n}\n```\n\n\u003e [For more information on Flex, read this article!](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp)\n\nNow, we'll set up the globe itself. First, we'll want to make the globe take up as much of the screen as possible. To do this, we'll use CSS's `vmin` unit to use the smallest screen dimension as a reference. To add some margin, we'll only want to take up around 85% of this space (so... `85vmin`). Next, we'll set the background to a nice, balmy blue (`#45b3e0`, to be exact.) After that, we'll round off the snowglobe by setting `border-radius` to 100%. We'll hide the `overflow` in order to keep things within limits. Then, we'll set the `margin` to `auto` in order to make the globe flow nicely within its new home. Finally, we'll add a nice glow effect!\n\n```css\n#snowglobe {\n\t/* Set the sizing*/\n\twidth: 85vmin;\n\theight: 85vmin;\n\t\n\t/* Nice, but temporary, background */\n\tbackground: #45b3e0;\n\t\n\t/* Make the globe round */\n\tborder-radius: 100%;\n\toverflow: hidden;\n\t\n\t/* Add some nice spacing */\n\tmargin: auto;\n\t\n\t/* And finally, add a nice glow*/\n\tbox-shadow: 0px 0px 20px 35px #FFFFFF05;\n}\n```\n\nAdding the ground and particle settings are easy at this point... we'll have the ground take up just 25% of the snowglobe and leave the rest to the sky.\n\n```css\n#particles {\n  height: 75%;\n  width: 100%;\n}\n\n#ground {\n  height: 25%;\n  width: 100%;\n  background: #bebebe; /* You can change this now or later if you want */\n}\n```\n\n#### Bonus: A shake animation!\nIf you want, we can add a fun little shake animation for whenever the snowglobe is activated! First, we'll add some springy keyframes. Then, we'll add a class called \"shake\" that we'll add to the snowglobe once it's activated.\n\n```css\n@keyframes shake {\n\t0%,\n\t100% {\n    transform: rotate(0deg);\n\t}\n\t\n\t25% {\n    transform: rotate(15deg);\n\t}\n\t\n\t50% {\n    transform: rotate(-15deg);\n\t}\n\t\n\t75% {\n    transform: rotate(10deg);\n\t}\n}\n\n.shake {\n  animation: shake 1s;\n}\n```\n\n\u003e [Read more about CSS Animations here!](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations)\n\n### Script it up!\nNow, after everything else is done, let's get the dirty work done!\n\nFirst, we'll add another script tag after the `snowglobe` div. Inside, we'll start writing some javascript. Let's declare some variables real quick...\n\n```js\n\t// Select the globe\n\tlet globe = document.getElementById(\"snowglobe\");\n\t\n\t// Declare particles\n\tlet particles;\n```\n\nNext, we'll add a function that will help us later on with activating the snowglobe when a device is shaken. This will accept an input event from the motion sensor on a device and calculate the magnitude with which the device was shaken. First, we'll grab the acceleration from the sensor. Then, we'll use a mathematical function that calculates the magnitude using those values. The function will finally return the result of that calculation.\n\n```js\n\t// Declare function for calculating Gyro activity\n\tfunction calculateAcceleration(event) {\n\t\tconst {x, y, z} = event.accelerationIncludingGravity;\n\t\tconst accelerationMagnitude = Math.sqrt(x * x + y * y + z * z);\n\t\treturn accelerationMagnitude;\n\t}\n```\n\nFinally, we'll add the function to handle shaking activation!\n\n```js\n\tfunction shakeItUp() {\n\t\tparticles.play();\n\t\t\n\t\t// Only include this code if you're making the shake animation\n\t\tglobe.classList.add(\"shake\")\n\t\tsetTimeout(() =\u003e {globe.classList.remove(\"shake\")}, 1100)\n\t}\n```\n\n### ↕ Choices, choices\nNow, time to tie it all together! tsParticles can load particle configuration in a number of ways, but one of the easiest is to load it from a `.json` file. Go ahead and download [this default snow configuration](https://cloud-66d7j3kh5-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0particles.json) and place it in your website root as `particles.json`. You can customize these values later.\n\nUnder the `calculateAcceleration()` function, add the command `tsParticles.load()`, which allows us to load the configuration. This command takes two inputs, element ID and configuration. Our element ID is the ID of the element where we want the particles to appear, and our configuration is the path to our config file, `particles.json`.\n\n```js\ntsParticles.loadJSON('particles', 'particles.json')\n```\n\nNext, we'll add a callback function. Inside we'll select the particles container and immediately pause the particles until they're shaken.\n\n```js\n    tsParticles.loadJSON('particles', 'particles.json')\n      .then(function () {\n        // Select the particle container and pause the particles\n        particles = tsParticles.domItem(0);\n        particles.pause()\n```\n\nThen, we'll add an event listener that calls the `shakeItUp()` function whenever the snowglobe is clicked/touched.\n\n```js\n        // Add globe event listener\n        globe.addEventListener('click', () =\u003e {\n          shakeItUp()\n        });\n```\n\n Then, we'll add an event listener that calls the `shakeItUp()` function whenever the snowglobe is clicked/touched. Finally, we'll add an event listener to the `window` element (provided by default) that detects gyroscope shifts and calculates its magnitude. Finally, it will compare this magnitude to a threshold (in testing, values between 17-23 seemed to work best) which can be adjusted if needed.  If this comparison passes, then it will call `shakeItUp()`. This is a lot at once, so take a look at the code below.\n\n```js\n    tsParticles.loadJSON('particles', 'particles.json')\n      .then(function () {\n        // Select the particle container and pause the particles\n        particles = tsParticles.domItem(0);\n        particles.pause()\n\n        // Add globe event listener\n        globe.addEventListener('click', () =\u003e {\n          shakeItUp()\n        });\n\n        // Add gyro event listener\n        window.addEventListener(\"devicemotion\", (event) =\u003e {\n          // Calculate the magnitude every time\n          const acceleration = calculateAcceleration(event);\n\n          // Compare the magnitude to threshold.\n          if (acceleration \u003e 23) {\n            shakeItUp()\n          }\n        });\n      });\n```\n\nAnd, that's all!\n\n\u003e [For more information on what event listeners are and how they work, check out this article!](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/e/event-listener.html/)\n\n# Customization\nAt this point, you have a nice, amazing snowglobe. Congratulations 🎉\nHowever, it's looking like all of these snowglobes are the same...\n\n![https://cloud-fcssxnb6l-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/](https://cloud-fcssxnb6l-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/8identical_snowglobes.png)\n\nLet's fix that by spicing them up a bit!\n\n## Setting the Setting (Adding a background)\n\n### Adding an Image\nAdding an image is super simple! If you don't have an image you'd like to use already, you can find one on a free service like [Unsplash!](https://unsplash.com/) \n\n![https://cloud-fcssxnb6l-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/](https://cloud-fcssxnb6l-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/3mountains.png)\n\u003e For example, this one.\n\nDownload the image and add it to the website folder (Err- upload it to your repl!) For simplicity, let's rename the file to `background.jpg` (or `.png`, etc.) Now, go into the CSS for the `#snowglobe` element. Let's change up that background...\n\n```css\n#snowglobe {\n\tbackground: url('/background.jpg') center/cover;\n}\n```\n\nNow, if you want to change up the position of the image within the globe, just change `center` in `center/cover`  to another location such as `right`, `top`, or `bottom`.\n\n![https://cloud-fcssxnb6l-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/](https://cloud-fcssxnb6l-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/4picture_globe.png)\n\u003e Hurrah, cool mountains!\n\n### Adding a Gradient\nTo keep it simple, you can use a tool like [cssgradient.io](https://cssgradient.io/) to generate a cool gradient background. Once you're done, all you need to do is copy the part that starts with `linear-gradient`.\n\n![https://cloud-fcssxnb6l-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/](https://cloud-fcssxnb6l-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/2gradient_highlighted.png)\n\u003e Just the highlighted part!\n\nNext, go into the CSS for the `#snowglobe` element. Let's change up that background...\n\n```css\n#snowglobe {\n\t/* You'll replace the gradient here with your own */\n\tbackground: linear-gradient(4deg, rgba(134, 100, 0, 1) 0%, rgba(121, 9, 9, 1) 32%, rgba(4, 0, 70, 1) 100%);\n}\n```\n\n![https://cloud-fcssxnb6l-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/](https://cloud-fcssxnb6l-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/5gradient_globe.png)\n\u003e A cool sunset made with the gradient `linear-gradient(4deg, rgba(134, 100, 0, 1) 0%, rgba(121, 9, 9, 1) 32%, rgba(4, 0, 70, 1) 100%)`\n\nIf you want an extra cool challenge, try animating it! See [the section on animation above](#### Bonus: A shake animation!) and try to figure it out for yourself!\n\n\u003e [If you'd like to learn more about CSS Gradients, you can read this article from MDN!](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient/linear-gradient)\n\n## It's raining, It's pouring! (Change what's falling)\nTo change what's falling, we'll need to go into the `particles.json` file. Here, we can change animation, color, or even shape!\n\n### Change the Color\nChanging the color is super easy! Just locate the `colors` object within `particles`. If you're using the default configuration, it should be near line 30. Change the `value` within this to whatever color you want and then you'll be good to go!\n\n### Change the Shape to a new Shape\nBy default, tsParticles allows you to use one of three different shapes: `square`, `circle`, and `triangle`. To change this, simply locate the `particles.shape` object within `particles.json`. If you're using the default config, this is located near line 129. Within this object, change the `type` to the shape you want. Ta-da! Now you have a new shape!\n\n### Make More Stuff Fall\ntsParticles allows you to adjust a `number` value to make more or less particles fall. It uses a density calculator to scale this value up or down, too. This value in the default config is located near line 106, under the `particles.number` object. Change the `value` to whichever value you'd like.\n\n\n## Twinkle, Twinkle (Add some music)\nFirst find some music! Legally, you should use some audio to which you have rights. [Check the internet archive for something to use!](https://archive.org/) \n\nAnyway, you'll want to download that audio and add it to the website directory (or upload it to your repl.) For simplicity, rename the file to `audio`. Under the `snowglobe` div, go ahead and add a new `audio` element with a single `source` child.\n\n```html\n\u003caudio id=\"music\"\u003e\n\t\u003c!-- replace the src and type with your respective file extentions --\u003e\n\t\u003csource src=\"audio.ogg\" type=\"audio/ogg\"\u003e\u003c/source\u003e\n\u003c/audio\u003e\n```\n\nNow, select the audio element. Then, add the line `music.play();` into the `shakeItUp()` function. \n\n```js\nlet music = document.getElementById('music')\n...\nfunction shakeItUp() {\n\t...\n\tmusic.play()\n}\n```\n\nCongratulations, now you have music!\n\n## It's an App! (Making it a PWA)\nAt this point, you have a cool snowglobe that's custom to you. Now, you can make it installable. Thankfully, you don't need to do much to create it as an installable app. You won't even need to have an App Store Developer account.\n\nIn order to do this, we'll use a web technology called a Progressive Web App (Or, PWA for short.) PWA uses a combination of smaller web technologies, like web manifests that declare your site and its content and service workers that allow your site to cache content and run in the background. All in all, it creates a neat little package for a web app.\n\nTo start, download [these assets](https://cloud-osijhtm8u-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0pwa.zip) and unzip them into the root of your project. If you want, you can generate these assets with a custom icon and color scheme using a tool like [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/), my personal favourite. Now, add the following HTML to the end of your head:\n\n```html\n  \u003c!-- PWA Stuff --\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/png\" sizes=\"32x32\" href=\"/favicon-32x32.png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/png\" sizes=\"16x16\" href=\"/favicon-16x16.png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"manifest\" href=\"/manifest.json\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"mask-icon\" href=\"/safari-pinned-tab.svg\" color=\"#3063ac\"\u003e\n  \u003cmeta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-title\" content=\"Snowglobe\"\u003e\n  \u003cmeta name=\"application-name\" content=\"Snowglobe\"\u003e\n  \u003cmeta name=\"msapplication-TileColor\" content=\"#2b5797\"\u003e\n  \u003cmeta name=\"theme-color\" content=\"#2e2e2e\"\u003e\n```\n\n\u003e Note: If you're using a custom pack, follow the instructions that they give instead.\n\nNow, if all has gone well, you should be able to install the website as a PWA! Congratulations! If you need help with this, [check out this article.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Guides/Installing)\n\nThat's all, folks!\n"

Even if you haven't, you've probably seen an hour long video of someone zooming into a picture, revealing more and more detail the farther they go.\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalinPlad/GLSLFractals/main/Zoom.gif\"/\u003e\n\nWell this particular geometrical shape shown in the GIF is part of a large family of *infinitely* detailed, *infinitely* precise object, called **fractals**. Today, we are going to write a computer program that will allow us to create the same fractal you see in the images above, namely, the ***Mandelbrot set***.\n\nThe Mandelbrot set is actually very interesting mathematically, and you can learn a lot by implementing a renderer for it. Thats what were going to do today, and you'll find out that theres so much more that you can do with fractals than just zooming in...\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalinPlad/GLSLFractals/main/capture.gif\"/\u003e\n\nLink to [example completed project](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/mlsczN)\n\n## What is the Mandelbrot set?\nThe Mandelbrot set is perhaps the most famous fractals ever discovered. We'll start coding soon, but first, we need to learn about the Mandelbrot set and how its derived.\n\nYou've probably heard of complex and imaginary numbers before, if not then here's a quick rundown. The *imaginary* number `i` is defined as being the square root of `-1`. You might think about this for a second, and then come to the conclusion of, wait, thats impossible! No number multiplied by itself equals -1, and thats true! No *real* number exists who's square is `-1`. Because of this limitation of real numbers, mathematicians created the imaginary number `i` which is defined as `i = √-1`.\n\nComplex numbers are just any number that has a **real** and **imaginary** component.\n\n`a  +  bi`\n\nIn that number, `a` represents the real part, and `bi` is the imaginary component. A good way to think of complex numbers is like mixed numbers, like \"one and three fourths\". Mixed numbers have a *whole* component and a *fractional* component, just as complex numbers have a *real* and *imaginary* component.\n\nSo how does this have anything to do with the Mandelbrot set, or fractals in general? Well there's something really cool we can do with these complex numbers.\n\n## The Complex Plane\nThe complex plane is a way to map any complex number to a point on a graph. To understand how it works, first look at this is an ordinary plane, with an ordinary point (point A) located at (4,6)\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalinPlad/GLSLFractals/main/real_graph.jpeg\" width=\"400\"/\u003e\n\nThe Complex Plane might sound complex but its just a way of translating any complex number into a point on a graph, and vice versa.\n\nYou'll recall that complex numbers have to form `a + bi`. To get the corresponding point on the plane, just take `a` as the x value and `b` as the y value.\n\nFor example, if we have the complex number `4 + 6i`, it's corresponding point on the complex plane would be `(4,6)`. Simple, right?\n\nAgain let me emphasize the form of complex numbers. **In `a + bi`, A is the *real* part of the complex number, and B is the *imaginary* part of the complex number**\n\nAnother way to visualize the complex plane is to rename the axes from the image above.\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalinPlad/GLSLFractals/main/complexPlane.jpeg\" width=\"500\"/\u003e\n\nNow you can see how the point `(4,6)` on the plane translates to the complex number `4 + 6i`\n\nSo now we have this method of converting any complex number to a point on the complex plane. So what can we do with that?\n\nWell this is where the actual formula for the Mandelbrot set comes in.\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalinPlad/GLSLFractals/main/MandelbrotEquation.jpeg\" width=\"500\"/\u003e\n\nThis might look pretty scary at first, but I promise it will make sense soon. First of all, what even is this? Essentially, this equation is a formula that we *recursively* apply to a complex number(like `2 + 3i`  or  `5 + 2i`). \n\nLet me walk you through the steps of the equation. This equation essentially just tell you how to calculate the next number in a sequence, so we kind of need a sequence to start with. Lets initialize one that just starts with the value of zero\n\n`Our sequence =\u003e 0`\n\nNow this formula needs an input. That input is a complex number. As you can recall we can take any point on the plane and use it as a complex number. So lets choose the point `(1,2)`, which corresponds to the complex number `1 + 2i`. Let's call this point `C`\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalinPlad/GLSLFractals/main/pointC.jpeg\" width=\"300\"/\u003e\n\nNow to find the next number in the sequence, the formula states we\n1. Take the **last** number in the sequence and **Square it**\n2. Add a complex number **C** to the result\n\nSo lets do that;\n\nCurrently our sequence is just `[0]` so in this case, `0` is the last number in the sequence, and for the complex number, ours is `1 + 2i`. So our equation for the next number in the sequence is\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalinPlad/GLSLFractals/main/index2.jpeg\" width=\"300\"/\u003e\n\nThe zero can be discarded and we are left with `(1 + 2i)`\n\n`Our sequence =\u003e 0, 1 + 2i`\n\nNow lets repeat that. Now to find the third number in the sequence, we take the square of the last number(which is what we just found), and add our complex number C to it.\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalinPlad/GLSLFractals/main/index3.jpeg\" width=\"500\"/\u003e\n\nWow! That's a lot longer than then the previous iteration, but thats only because we are squaring a complex number now. As you can see, we basically treat `i` as any normal algebriac variable, except for one special case.\n\nHopefully you recall how `i` is defined\n\t`i = √-1`\n\t`i^2 = -1`\nThis just means that we need to convert `i^2` to `-1` whenever we see it in our math\n\n(don't worry the computer will take care of all of this once we code it ;)\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalinPlad/GLSLFractals/main/index3squared.jpeg\" width=\"300\"/\u003e\n\nNow our sequence looks like this\n\n`Our sequence =\u003e 0, 1 + 2i, -2 + 6i`\n\nWe can also plot this new point on the complex plane (as well as our starting point of `0`)\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalinPlad/GLSLFractals/main/graphIndex3.jpeg\" width=\"300\"/\u003e\n\nVery soon we'll see some emergent behavior from this system, but first lets quickly do one more iteration\n\n(Only look at this next equation if you really care)\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalinPlad/GLSLFractals/main/index4.jpeg\" width=\"500\"/\u003e\n\n`Our sequence =\u003e 0, 1 + 2i, -2 + 6i, -31 - 22i`\n\nNow our graph looks like this:\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalinPlad/GLSLFractals/main/graphIndex4.jpeg\" width=\"500\"/\u003e\n\nWell there goes our point... At this point its obvious that if we continue this sequence it will eventually spiral out to infinity. So we can classify this point as... Drumroll please..... Not in the Mandelbrot set!!!!\n\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalinPlad/GLSLFractals/main/whatjusthappened.gif\" width=\"300\"/\u003e\n\n\n\nOk, lets back up. First, we chose and arbitrary point on the complex plane: `(1,2)`. Then we **recursively called the Mandelbrot Equation on it**. On every iteration we graphed the points new position and saw that as we ran the function for more and more iterations, the point was quickly escaping the graph and heading out towards infinity.\n\n\nSo back to what I was saying about this point not being in the Mandelbrot set. *(This next part is an important key concept so listen up)*\n\n**Any point on the complex plane will either blow up to infinity or fall into some sort of stable orbit**\n\nTo see what I mean, lets try a different point. This time I'll leave out all of the equations behind the scenes and just show you the end graph.\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalinPlad/GLSLFractals/main/secondPointPath.jpeg\" width=\"500\"/\u003e\n\nYou can see that instead of escaping out into infinity, this point seems to do the opposite, and sort of falls in towards the center and floats around. This type of point, one that does not explode out into infinity, *is* in the Mandelbrot set.\n\n## Intro to Shadertoy\n\nAt long last, its time to take all of our newly gained knowledge and make something out of it. We're going to be using **Shader Toy**, which is kind of like replit for high performance graphics shaders. Shader Toy lets us write **GLSL** shaders that run on the GPU. \n\n**GLSL** is the language of WebGL, which is a technology that allows developers to write high performance graphics on the web.\n\nGo to `shadertoy.com` and sign up for an account. You can complete this Jam without an account if you want, but if you want to share your finished product or save your shader, you need to sign up for a free account.\n\nOnce you are logged in, click the `New` button in the top right.\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalinPlad/GLSLFractals/main/newbutton.png\" width=\"400\"/\u003e\n\nAfter you click that, you'll land on a page that looks like this\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalinPlad/GLSLFractals/main/newshader.png\" width=\"500\"/\u003e\n\nI've gone ahead and filled out the Title and Description for this Jam. Now lets get into GLSL!\n\n## Intro to GLSL\n\nWe can see that we have a default starter shader already loaded. We're going to start from scratch so begin by replacing all the code in the code box with the following basic script. **Make sure to recompile by clicking the play button at the bottom left of the code box.**\n\n```c\nvoid mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )\n{\n    // Normalized pixel coordinates (from 0 to 1)\n    vec2 uv = fragCoord/iResolution.xy;\n\n    // Output to screen\n    fragColor = vec4(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);\n}\n```\n\nHere we can see our main function. **This function will be run for every pixel in our image.** Lets walk through the lines.\n\n```c\nvoid mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )\n```\n\nThis defines the main function. `mainImage()` is the convention in ShaderToy. We can see that we are outputting a single `vec4` variable named ***fragColor***, and have access to one `vec2` variable named ***fragCoord***.\n\n***fragCoord*** is the basic input to the shader and is different for every pixel. It is basically just a `vec2` containing the x and y position of the current pixel.\n\n\n\nOkay, before we continue, I haven't explained what vectors are, so lets do that quickly;\n\n---\n\n###### What are vectors\nThroughout this Jam, and whenever programming in GLSL, you'll see countless examples of Vectors being used. `vec` is a datatype that is used very prominently in GLSL. They each contain either 2, 3, or 4 entries.\n\n```C\n// Vectors example\n\n// 2D Vector\nvec2 position = vec2(2.0, 3.0)\n\nposition.x // =\u003e 2.0\nposition.y // =\u003e 3.0\n\n// OR\n\nposition[0] // =\u003e 2.0\nposition[1] // =\u003e 3.0\n\n\n// 3D Vector\nvec3 position_3D = vec3(2.0, 5.3, 1.0)\n\nposition_3D.x // =\u003e 2.0\nposition_3D.y // =\u003e 5.3\nposition_3D.z // =\u003e 1.0\n```\n\nOkay, now back to the shader code\n\n---\n\n```c\n// Normalized pixel coordinates (from 0 to 1)\nvec2 uv = fragCoord/iResolution.xy;\n```\n\nThis line just normalizes our coordinates. If we just use the input to the function, `fragCoord`, the values would be from `1 - width/height of screen`, which would be different for every computer and browser running our program. To solve this, we can use ShaderToy's built in variable `iResolution` to get the screens resolution, and divide `fragCoord` by it. Now we have a new variable, `uv`, which is the current pixels position on the screen, normalized so that all the values fall between 0 and 1.\n\nHeres a simple diagram to show what uv coordinates are\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalinPlad/GLSLFractals/main/textureUV.jpeg\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\n\n***By default we are given the texture coordinate for the pixel, so in this line we just calculate the corresponding UV coordinate.***\n\n\n\nOn to the next line! (Arguably the most important one)\n\n```C\n// Output to screen\nfragColor = vec4(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);\n```\n\nThis is the equivalent of \"`return`\" ing a value in most other programming languages. `fragColor` is an special variable in the GLSL language. It stands for the color of the current pixel. It is a `vec4` variable that holds the `RGBA` color.\n\n\t`fragColor = vec4(RED, GREEN, BLUE, ALPHA);\n\nAlpha is just a fancy word for opacity, so lets keep it at 100% for now\n\nYou may be used to writing color out on a range from 0 to 255. But like we did for the UV coordinates, GLSL expects these values to be normalized, so a value of 1 is 100% and 0 is 0%.\n\nWhen our shader exits execution, the value of `fragColor` will be applied to the current pixel.\n\nTry modifying your shader to look like this.\n\n```C\nvoid mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )\n{\n    // Normalized pixel coordinates (from 0 to 1)\n    vec2 uv = fragCoord/iResolution.xy;\n\n\t// Output based on if current pixels x position is greater than 0.5\n    if(uv.x \u003e 0.5){\n        fragColor = vec4(1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0);\n    } else {\n\t    fragColor = vec4(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalinPlad/GLSLFractals/main/outputRedBlack.png\" width=\"300\"/\u003e\n\nRemember that the normalized UV coordinates mean that the halfway line is at x position 0.5, so by coloring pixels who's x UV position is greater than 0.5 red, we get this simple pattern. Try changing 0.5 in the code and seeing what happens.\n\nAnother thing you can try is just setting the red value of the `fragColor` to the pixels UV x coordinate\n\n```C\nvoid mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )\n{\n    // Normalized pixel coordinates (from 0 to 1)\n    vec2 uv = fragCoord/iResolution.xy;\n    \n    // Output to screen\n    fragColor = vec4(uv.x, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);\n}\n```\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalinPlad/GLSLFractals/main/outputRed.png\" width=\"300\"/\u003e\n\nThen you could even set the blue value equal to the pixel UV y coordinate\n\n```C\nfragColor = vec4(0.0, 0.0, uv.y, 1.0);\n```\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalinPlad/GLSLFractals/main/outputBlue.png\" width=\"300\"/\u003e\n\nThen combine them into one statement that sets the Red value to the X position and the blue value to the Y position\n\n```C\nfragColor = vec4(uv.x, 0.0, uv.y, 1.0);\n```\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalinPlad/GLSLFractals/main/outputPurple.png\" width=\"300\"/\u003e\n\n## Coding the Mandelbrot set\n\nHopefully you're still with me, and hopefully you've either miraculously understood everything up until this point, or you are frantically searching on youtube for a better explanation of the Mandelbrot set(in which case I recommend [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiAj9WW1OfQ), [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFftmWSzgmk), and [The Mandelbrot Set: Atheists’ WORST Nightmare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlD2rcm971U))(Watch that last one at your own risk)\n\nWe are dealing with some pretty high level and abstract mathematical concepts here, so if you want to have a solid foundation going into the end of this Jam, make sure you understand the math.\n\nWith that said, lets start coding our final product!\n\nBack in ShaderToy, replace the `fragColor` line and rename the `uv` variable to `c`, because thats the name for the current point in the Mandelbrot equation.\n\n```C\nvoid mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )\n{\n    // Normalized pixel coordinates (from 0 to 1)\n    vec2 c = fragCoord/iResolution.xy;\n    \n    // Output to screen\n    fragColor = vec4(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);\n}\n```\n\nLets define some constants. First, we need a limit for how many times we want to iterate before deciding if the point explodes out to infinity or stays in a stable orbit. The higher the number, the more accurate the image will be, but the slower our program will be.\n\n```C\n// Maximum number of iterations\nint maxIterations = 256;\n```\n\nLets also add our initial Mandelbrot starting point of (0,0)\n\n```C\n// Starting point\nvec2 Z = vec2(0,0)\n```\n\nWe can say our variable `c` is a complex number with its x component being the real part and y component being the imaginary part, so lets write out a quick helper function to handle the \"complex\" arithmetic\n\n```C\n// Squares a given complex number\nvec2 cSquare( in vec2 z ) \n{\n    return vec2(\n            z.x * z.x - z.y * z.y,\n            2.0 * z.x * z.y\n        );\n}\n\nvoid mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )\n{\n    // Normalized pixel coordinates (from 0 to 1)\n    vec2 c = fragCoord/iResolution.xy;\n    \n    // Maximum number of iterations\n    int maxIterations = 256;\n\n\t// Starting point\n\tvec2 Z = vec2(0,0);\n    \n    // Output to screen\n    fragColor = vec4(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);\n}\n```\n\nDon't worry too much about this function- Just know that its there because programming languages aren't really designed for complex math. This function just does the math in a way that the computer can understand.\n\nNow it's time to actually implement the Mandelbrot loop. Lets create a for loop in our main function after we define our `maxIterations`.\n\n```C\nfor(int i = 0; i \u003c maxIterations; i = i + 1)\n{\n    // Z(n+1) = Z(n)^2 + C\n}\n```\n\n(Also don't worry about the curly braces being indented to the next line its just a thing in GLSL ;)\n\nNow heres where our two functions from earlier come into play. \n\n```C\nfor(int i = 0; i \u003c maxIterations; i++)\n{\n    // Z(n+1) = Z(n)^2 + C\n    vec2 oldZ = Z;\n    Z = cSquare(oldZ) + c;\n} \n```\n\nGreat! Now we just need to check wether or not the point escapes to infinity. In practice, we don't need to check if it actually gets that far, We can just check if it gets farther that **2** units away from the origin. Thats because all of this beautiful behavior happens on a very small scale so anything that makes it that far is almost definitely heading to infinity.\n\nAdd this if statement to the bottom of the for loop\n\n```C\n// If the point escapes, color it differently\nif(dot(Z, Z) \u003e 4.0) {\n    fragColor = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);\n    break;\n} else {\n    fragColor = vec4(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);\n}\n```\n\nthe `dot()` function is just a way of measuring how far away from the origin the point is.\n\nRe compile and... Nothing! Thats because if we look at the bottom of our code...\n\n```C\n\t\t//...\n        {\n            fragColor = vec4(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Output to screen\n    fragColor = vec4(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);\n}\n```\n\nWe change the value of `fragColor` back to pure black on the last line of the main function. Just delete these lines-\n\n```C\n// Output to screen\nfragColor = vec4(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);\n```\n\nAnd then we get this image:\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalinPlad/GLSLFractals/main/mvpImage.png\" width=\"300\"/\u003e\n\n...\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalinPlad/GLSLFractals/main/notGood.gif\" width=\"300\"/\u003e\n\n## Fixing visual bugs\n\nWell hey, at least we're making progress! If we compare our image with another render of the set-\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalinPlad/GLSLFractals/main/Mandlebrot.png\" width=\"300\"/\u003e\n\nWe can see several issues\n\n* Framing: We are only seeing a small part of the set\n* Stretching: Our image is horizontally compressed\n* Color: Ours is ugly\n\nFirst up, lets fix the stretching. Remember when I talked about converting texture to UV coordinates, here lets look at the picture again real quick\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalinPlad/GLSLFractals/main/textureUV.jpeg\" width=\"400\"/\u003e\n\nWell the problem is that in our original texture coordinates, the Y axis(height) is 720 pixels, which is 560 pixels shorter than the X axis(width). This is a size difference of 43.75%, while in the UV Coordinates, both the X and Y axis are forced to be the same length, which effectively stretches the Y axis and shrinks the X axis. Not good for our Mandelbrot image.\n\nTo fix this, we can just change which axis we choose to use to convert to UV space. Currently, we use both independently\n\n```C\n// Normalized pixel coordinates (from 0 to 1)\nvec2 c = fragCoord/iResolution.xy;\n```\n\nInstead we can just choose one axis to use to stretch both axis equally. In this case we just use the x axis because of very important reasons(I choose randomly ;)\n\n(In the code just delete the Y at the end of the line)\n\n```C\n// Normalized pixel coordinates (from 0 to 1)\nvec2 c = fragCoord/iResolution.x;\n```\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalinPlad/GLSLFractals/main/unStretched.png\" width=\"300\"/\u003e\n\nMore progress!\n\nNow for the framing. This is kind of two problems in one, the scale(zoom), and the translation. First, like deal with the scale. We can deal with this by literally changing the plane on which the points are located\n\n```C\n// Normalized pixel coordinates (from 0 to 1)\nvec2 c = fragCoord/iResolution.x;\n    \n// Scale [lower is more zoomed in]\nfloat scale = 4.0;\n    \nc *= scale;\n```\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalinPlad/GLSLFractals/main/scaled.png\" width=\"300\"/\u003e\n\nAnd this makes sense when you think about it. Now, our plane is **4 times bigger**, so all points are now **4 time farther apart**. The smaller this number is(or more accurately, the closer it approaches to zero) the farther we will zoom into the set.\n\nNow for translation. This is pretty simple, we can just directly apply transformations to the point.\n\n```C\n// Normalized pixel coordinates (from 0 to 1)\nvec2 c = fragCoord/iResolution.x;\n    \n// Scale [lower is more zoomed in]\nfloat scale = 4.0;\n    \nc *= scale;\n\n// Move set into view\nc += vec2(-2.7,-1.1);\n```\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalinPlad/GLSLFractals/main/transformed.png\" width=\"300\"/\u003e\n\nI came up with these transformation with trail and error by the way, which is the way that you do a LOT of stuff in GLSL. Unlike more languages, GLSL has zero output other than the end shader result. There is no way to debug a variable, or even `console.log()` or `print()`\n\nNow for the fun part.. COLORS!!\n\n## Adding color\n\nThere are a few ways we can color this set, and we have lots of information about a pixel to use when coloring it, but a really popular way to do it is to follow this flow\n1. Is the point in the Mandelbrot set? \n\t1. Yes: Color that point **BLACK**\n\t2. No: Color that point **Based on *how many iterations it took before the point escaped to infinity***\n\nLuckily we are already doing the calculation in a for loop, so we have access to the variable `i`, which tells us how many iterations have passed. When we hit the if statement and we have escaped, we can use that variable `i` to see how many iterations have passed. Lets try making a greyscale image with `i` being the brightness if the point escapes. \n\nOne thing to remember is that we need to normalize the variable first, so we can just divide it by `maxIterations`\n\n```C\nif(dot(Z, Z) \u003e 4.0) {\n\t// Normalize i for brightness\n\tfloat brightness = float(i) / float(maxIterations)\n\t\n    fragColor = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);\n    break;\n```\n\nThe cool thing is that `vectors` have a pretty amazing constructor so if we run `vec3(1.0)` the constructor will fill in the other two value with the single one provided\n\n```C\na = vec3(1.0) // =\u003e vec3(1.0, 1.0, 1.0)\nb = vec4(2.4) // =\u003e vec4(2.4, 2.4, 2.4, 2.4)\n\nvec4(a, 5.0) // =\u003e vec4(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 5.0)\n```\n\nSo lets use that to generate the brightness of the pixel\n\n```C\nif(dot(Z, Z) \u003e 4.0) {\n    // Normalize i for brightness\n    float brightness = float(i) / float(maxIterations);\n            \n    fragColor = vec4(vec3(brightness), 1.0);\n    break;\n```\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalinPlad/GLSLFractals/main/bw.png\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\nCONGRATULATIONS, you just successfully rendered the Mandelbrot set! We still have a few more additions, like color, and camera movements.\n\n## Color weights\n\nFirst, lets explore some different ways of coloring the set. One popular way is to apply different **weights** to the RED GREEN and BLUE values instead of them all using the same values.\n\nBasically it just means that we can make the RED GREEN and BLUE values increase at different rates, causing more diverse colors.\n\nSo to reiterate, currently we are raising the RGB value equally\n\n```C\n// Current method. All channels(R G and B) increase at same rate\nnumIters = 10\nRGB(10,10,10)\n\nnumIters = 30\nRGB(30,30,30)\n```\n\nwhich means that all the possible values will be different shades of white. Instead of that, we can change how much each RGB value increases based on how much the number of iterations increases\n\n```C\n// New method. Apply different weights(mulitpliers) to channels\nnumIters = 10\nRGB(10,8,6)\n\nnumIters = 30\nRGB(30,20,10)\n```\n\nSo lets actually implement that. Add a weights variable and multiply the brightness value by it.\n\n```C\n// multipliers for ( R   G   B ) values\nvec3 weights = vec3(1.0,1.0,1.0);\n\nfragColor = vec4(vec3(brightness) * weights, 1.0);\nbreak;\n```\n\nRight now, we have the same multiplier for all the value. Lets try making the set more blue\n\n```C\nvec3 weights = vec3(1.0,1.0,2.0);\n```\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalinPlad/GLSLFractals/main/blueset.png\" width=\"500\"/\u003e\n\nCool! Now try out some more combinations of weights to color the set.\n\n\tTip: try bigger numbers (\u003e10.0)\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalinPlad/GLSLFractals/main/greenset.png\" width=\"500\"/\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalinPlad/GLSLFractals/main/yellowset.png\" width=\"500\"/\u003e\n\nChoose a color that you love, and then we can move onto smooth (log) coloring\n\n## Smooth colors\nYou probably noticed the banding on the image. The brightness values doesn't produce a perfect gradient, instead it steps down in large increments. We can fix this by making use of the double log formula. I'm not going to go into depth on this, but feel free to research it if you want to.\n\nFirst replace the brightness variable declaration as so\n```C\nfloat brightness = (float(i) - log2(log2(dot(Z,Z))) + 4.0) / float(maxIterations);\n```\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalinPlad/GLSLFractals/main/almostBanding.png\" width=\"500\"/\u003e\n\nThis doesn't completely fix the problem, because we change the the brightness formula, we need to increase the escape radius as well from `4` to `20`.\n\n```C\nif(dot(Z, Z) \u003e 20.0) {\n```\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalinPlad/GLSLFractals/main/bandingFixed.png\" width=\"500\"/\u003e\n\n!!! BEAUTIFUL !!! Now for my favorite part of the jam\n## Make it your own\nIm going to leave you guys with two more tool that will allow you to create infinite variations of the Mandelbrot set....\n\n1. Mutating the Mandelbrot formula\n2. Using `iTime`\n\nBefore we do that, heres what our code looks like right now so you can catch up;\n\n```C\n// Squares a given complex number\nvec2 cSquare( in vec2 z ) \n{\n    return vec2(\n            z.x * z.x - z.y * z.y,\n            2.0 * z.x * z.y\n        );\n}\n\nvoid mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )\n{\n    // Normalized pixel coordinates (from 0 to 1)\n    vec2 c = fragCoord/iResolution.x;\n    \n    // Scale [lower is more zoomed in]\n    float scale = 4.0;\n    \n    c *= scale;\n    \n    // Move set into view\n    c += vec2(-2.7,-1.1);\n    \n    // Maximum number of iterations\n    int maxIterations = 256;\n\n\t// Starting point\n\tvec2 Z = vec2(0,0);\n    \n    for(int i = 0; i \u003c maxIterations; i++)\n    {\n        // Z(n+1) = Z(n)^2 + C\n        vec2 oldZ = Z;\n        Z = cSquare(oldZ) + c;\n        \n        if(dot(Z, Z) \u003e 20.0) {\n            // Normalize i for brightness\n            float brightness = (float(i) - log2(log2(dot(Z,Z))) + 4.0) / float(maxIterations);\n            \n            // multipliers for ( R   G   B ) values\n            vec3 weights = vec3(10.0,10.0,2.0);\n            \n            fragColor = vec4(vec3(brightness) * weights, 1.0);\n            break;\n        } else {\n            fragColor = vec4(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow if you click on the `shader inputs` drop down directly above the code box...\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalinPlad/GLSLFractals/main/shaderInputs.png\" width=\"500\"/\u003e\n\nYou can see a list of **built in variables**. These variables provide access to some important information about the current state of our shader.\n\nThe most important one is `iTime`. It returns the current time of the shader animation as a float. It is very powerful when combined with a trigonometric function like `sin() cos() and tan()`.\n\n```C\n// multipliers for ( R   G   B ) values\nvec3 weights = vec3(sin(iTime) * 2.0 + 5.0, cos(iTime) * 3.0 + 5.0, sin(iTime) * 10.0);\n            \nfragColor = vec4(vec3(brightness) * weights, 1.0);\n```\n\nAgain, really play around with these values! There are infinite permutations of these functions combined with `iTime` to explore!\n\nAnd my personal favorite way to make this yours is to edit the actual Mandelbrot formula. Remember this?\n\n```C\n// Z(n+1) = Z(n)^2 + C\nvec2 oldZ = Z;\nZ = cSquare(oldZ) + c;\n```\n\nChange it to anything. I mean it!! Try messing around with the function, like multiplying `c`, running `cSquare` multiple times, inverting variables, adding noise, subtracting value, multiplying by itself, literally anything will give you a unique output. Heres some examples for inspiration.\n\n\n```C\nvec2 oldZ = Z;\nZ = cSquare(oldZ + c) + c + cSquare(c * sin(iTime));\n```\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalinPlad/GLSLFractals/main/mandelPerm1.png\" width=\"500\"/\u003e\n\n```C\nvec2 oldZ = Z;\nZ = cSquare(c) + c + cSquare(oldZ - sin(iTime));\n```\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalinPlad/GLSLFractals/main/mandelPerm2.png\" width=\"500\"/\u003e\n\n```C\nvec2 oldZ = Z;\nZ = cSquare(cSquare(oldZ) + c);\n```\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalinPlad/GLSLFractals/main/mandelPerm3.png\" width=\"500\"/\u003e\n\n## Final Thoughts! + Source Code\n\nJust like everything in this jam... Just play with it! almost everything in this jam can be modified, tweaked, and changed to make this project yours! The best thing about writing this renderer in ShaderToy is that its all real time! No render time to wait, just change something and immediately see its effect.  If you want to keep learning, here are some resources and questions to keep learning with\n\n1. Try messing with the `cSquare()` function. Maybe it doesn't have to \"square\" the complex number? Change it up randomly (z.y =\u003e z.x)\n2. Try increasing / decreasing the max iterations and the escape radius\n3. What are some other ways that color the set? Try using trigonometric functions...\n4. I wonder what the `iMouse` builtin variable does..\n5. Right now we color any points inside the Mandelbrot set black.. How else can we color them?\n\n\nFinally, I want to leave you guys with 3 ShaderToy links, two of a fully completed example projects, and one of the project in its current state, so you can fork it if you ever got lost along the way. I hope you learned something, and happy hacking!\n\n\n[Example Project, Fully Complete](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/clfcRs) \n\n[Example Project, Also Fully Complete](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/mlsczN) \n\n[Example Project, Base Code To Fork](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/dlXcDj) \n"

With these skills, you'll be able to tackle even more complex boards, such as a custom macropad or fidget toy.\n\n## Schematic\n\nThe first step is creating a schematic for your PCB design. A schematic shows the components that will be used in the circuit, as well as how each of these components connect to each other. An important thing to note -- a schematic is only a diagram of what connects to what, not where the components are actually placed on the board, so don't worry about placement at this stage!\n\n\nFirst, let's open up [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com), which is a browser-based (and free) PCB design tool. \nIt can be a little bit tricky to get used to, so we made a [very short video](https://youtu.be/lEcN3JnTge4).\n\nWhen you go to the website, you should see a screen like this. Click `Sign Up` to create an account, if you don't already have one.\n\n![](https://cloud-qega55fyl-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/8new-project.png)\n\nClick on the `EasyEDA Designer` button in the Navbar to open up the schematic editor. \n\nOnce you've logged in, select `File` \u003e `New` \u003e `Project` to create a new project.\n![](https://cloud-qega55fyl-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/8new-project.png)\n\nThis will open up the schematic editor. Some important parts:\n\n- `Library` on the left toolbar: This is where we will search for components and place them into our schematic.\n- `Wiring Tools` panel: We'll be using the wire tool to connect the components together.\n\n![](https://cloud-lagxcclbp-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/3schematic.png)\n\n## Placing components into the schematic\n\nFor our card, we'll want a capacitor, a resistor, a 2V LED and a NFC chip:\n\n- A [NT3H2111W0FHKH](https://jlcpcb.com/partdetail/NxpSemicon-NT3H2111W0FHKH/C710403) NFC Chip: this will be the main component of our card -- it both handles the NFC functionality as well as harvests energy from the phone to light up the LED\n- An ~2V LED. I'm using [C2296](https://jlcpcb.com/partdetail/Hubei_KentoElec-17_21SUYCTR8/C2296), but feel free to pick a different color (note: this part may also be called 17-21SUYC/TR8)\n- A [47Ω resistor](https://jlcpcb.com/partdetail/23909-0603WAF470JT5E/C23182)\n- A [220nF capacitor](https://jlcpcb.com/partdetail/21832-CL10B224KA8NNNC/C21120)\n\nClick the `Library` button to open the parts picker. Search for a part (the part number works best), and make sure `JLCPCB Assembled` is selected. This will make sure we're choosing parts from JLCPCB's parts library, as this is currently Hack Club's Onboard PCB manufacturer. \n\n![](https://cloud-lagxcclbp-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/4searching-for-parts.png)\n\nSelect the part, then hit the `Place` button to add it to your schematic. Repeat for all 4 of the parts listed above.\n\n![](https://cloud-qega55fyl-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/9parts-on-schematic.png)\n\n\u003e Note: The EasyEDA parts library may not always be helpful when finding parts for your own future projects, so feel free to search the internet for parts and their codes. You can also create your own parts, but that's a bit more advanced.\n\n### Adding the antenna\n\nThe NFC chip needs an antenna to work. We'll be using a PCB trace (a line of copper in the board) as the antenna, so we'll need to add that to our schematic.\n\nNote: this is not an actual part, so it doesn't need to be assembled onto the board -- it's formed by the copper traces on the PCB.\n\nTo add the antenna, search for `25X48MM_NFC_ANTENNA` in the Library, and instead of `JLCPCB Assembled`, select `User Contributed`. Select one of the options (check the preview to make sure it looks similar to the one I used here, but most of them should work), and place it on your schematic.\n\n![](https://cloud-lagxcclbp-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/5selecting-antenna.png)\n\n## Wiring up the components\n\nNow that all of our components are placed, let's connect them together! Make sure to save your work (command-s or control-s) as you go along.\n\nThe `Wire` tool indicates an electrical connection between the different parts -- this is similar to how you would connect wires on a breadboard. On the actual PCB, copper traces will go where we added wires, to form those electrical connections.\n\nWe'll reference the NFC Chip's Datasheet (yes, that obscure, horrifyingly detailed document), specifically [this explanation](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/NT3H2111_2211.pdf#page=38) for creating an energy harvesting circuit.\n\nThe datasheet says\n\n\u003e A complete total connected capacitor in the range of typically 150 nF up to 220 nF\n\u003e maximum shall be connected between VOUT and GND\n\nSo we'll connect the capacitor between `VOUT` and GND (the `VSS` pin).\n\n\u003cvideo src=\"https://cloud-bfxdnmxrd-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1wire-tool.mp4\" controls=\"controls\" style={{ maxWidth: \"480px\" }}\u003e\u003c/video\u003e\n\n- The pins `LA` and `LB` are for the antenna, so we'll wire up the antenna between those two pins.\n- \u003e If NTAG I2C also powers the I2C bus, then VCC must be connected to VOUT\n\n  Since the NFC chip will use the power transmitted from the phone to power the chip itself, we'll connect `VCC` to `VOUT`.\n\n- Finally, to complete the circuit and light up the LED, we'll connect the LED and resistor between `VOUT` and GND (the `VSS` pin).\n\nYour schematic should look something like this when completed:\n\n\u003e Note that your schematic may look a bit different from mine -- that's okay! As long as the connections are the same, it should work. So feel free to experiment with different layouts, maybe keep the antenna on the right or change the position of LEDs and resistors? It's up to you!\n\n![](https://cloud-qega55fyl-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/3completed-schematic.png)\n\n\u003e Friendly reminder to save (`command + s` or `control + s`) your work! You can also click `Project` \u003e `Save Project` to save your schematic. \n\n# Designing the PCB\n\nNow that the schematic is complete, we can start designing the actual PCB. In this step, we'll place the components onto the board, in the exact shape and configuration that the final board will be. The schematic is our guide to how to connect the components together.\n\n## Converting the schematic to a PCB\n\nTo convert the schematic into a PCB design file, click `Design` \u003e `Convert Schematic to PCB`. You may get a warning about unfinished nets -- this is fine, just click \"No, Keep Going.\"\n\n![](https://cloud-qega55fyl-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/5convert-schematic-to-pcb.png)\n\nThis will open up the PCB editor, as well as a popup window to specify the board's dimensions. (If the popup window doesn't show up for any reason, you can find it through `Tools` \u003e `Set Board Outline`.)\n\nHere are the dimensions I'll be using, but feel free to make your business card a different size! Bonus: try making your business card a custom shape (not circular or rectangular). You should have the tools to do that by the end of the jam.\n\n- Board Outline: Round Rectangular\n- Width: 88.9mm\n- Height: 50.8mm\n- Radius: 4mm\n\n![](https://cloud-lagxcclbp-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/6set-board-outline.png)\n\n## Functionality: Making a working PCB card\n\nOnce you set the board outline, you should see something like the image below. There's the outline of the board in pink, a bunch of components in red, and some thin blue lines connecting the components. Let's talk about what these are, and what the colors mean!\n\n![](https://cloud-lagxcclbp-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0pcb-editor.png)\n\n### Layers\n\nA PCB like a sandwich -- it's made up of many different layers. We're designing a 2-layer PCB, which has the following layers:\n\n- The **substrate** is in the middle. This makes up the foundation of the PCB, and is usually made of FR-4 (fiberglass).\n- On either side of the substrate are **copper layers** (since this is a 2-layer PCB, there are 2 copper layers: one on top and one on the bottom). In our PCB designer, these are indicated by the `TopLayer` (red) and `BottomLayer` (blue) layers. The copper layers are where electrical connections happen! You should place **traces** (lines that form electrical connections between components) on the `TopLayer` and `BottomLayer`.\n- On top of the copper layers are **soldermask** layers. This is what gives PCBs their color -- common soldermask colors are green or black, but white, purple, blue, red, yellow, and more are also possible. Soldermask is added to the entire surface of the board (both the top and the bottom) by default. If you want to **remove** the soldermask (which will reveal the copper underneath), use the `TopSolderMaskLayer` or `BottomSolderMaskLayer` (for the top and bottom of the board, respectively).\n- On top of the soldermask layers are **silkscreen** layers. Silkscreen is usually white, and is generally used to label and identify components, but we'll be using it for ✨ PCB art ✨. We can use this to add contact info, a QR code, or even some illustrations to our business card. In EasyEDA, silkscreen is added on the `TopSilkLayer` and `BottomSilkLayer`.\n\n![](https://cloud-lagxcclbp-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1pcb-layers.png)\n\n### Components\n\nYou'll notice that the PCB designer already has your components populated on the board. By converting the schematic to a PCB design, EasyEDA automatically places the **footprints** of the components on the board. Try dragging these around! You're able to place them anywhere, but keep in mind that they must be placed within the pink board outline. This is exactly how the components will be placed on the final board.\n\nSome helpful tips:\n\n- You can hit the `R` key to rotate a component 90 degrees.\n- The thin blue lines indicate where electrical connections need to be made; so try to rotate components so that the lines do not cross\n- Don't worry if the yellow marks cross (that's just silkscreen), but the red parts should not be touching! (That's the copper layer, and if they touch, it will cause a short circuit.)\n\nDrag the components around until you're happy with the placement. Here's what mine looks like, but don't copy it directly; almost anything will work!\n\n![](https://cloud-qega55fyl-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/4components-placed.png)\n\n### Routing traces\n\nNow, we have a bunch of components on the card. If we were to have the card manufactured right now, it wouldn't work -- the components are not connected to each other! We need to add **traces** to connect the components together.\n\nIt's best practice to manually route your traces, using the first button in the PCB tools panel: the `Track` tool.\n\n![](https://cloud-lagxcclbp-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/2pcb-tools.png)\n\nHowever, to speed up the jam a bit, we'll be using EasyEDA's auto-router. Select `Route` \u003e `Auto Route...` and click `Run` to watch the magic happen...\n\n![](https://cloud-qega55fyl-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0auto-router.png)\n\n...Except, it seems like the magical autorouter 🪄 wasn't 100% successful :(. We'll finish up the last bit with some manual routing.\n\n![](https://cloud-qega55fyl-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1autorouter-results.png)\n\nIn my case, the autorouter was able to connect most of the components, but there's still one thin blue line (representing an unrouted connection). Can you find it?\n\nZooooming in, we see that it's between the antenna loop and pin #8 on the NFC chip. Here's how to route it:\n\n1. Click the `Track` tool in the PCB Tools panel\n2. On the right sidebar, set `Routing Conflict` to `Ignore`. This step is generally not needed (for normal manual routing), but there's a small issue with the footprints that makes it necessary here.\n3. Click between the two pads that need to be connected. The thin blue line should disappear, and a red trace should connect the two pads.\n\n\u003cvideo src=\"https://cloud-bfxdnmxrd-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0manual-routing.mp4\" controls=\"controls\" style={{ maxWidth: \"480px\" }}\u003e\u003c/video\u003e\n\nNow, your PCB card is functional. Woooo! 🎉\n\n_WARNING: Make sure your design has no short circuits_\n\u003cDropdown title=\"Hey, what's a short circuit and how can I prevent it?\"\u003e  \n           Short circuits is a circuits that allow current to travel along an unintended path. \n\n          Heres a simple example:\n          ![](https://cloud-m5qt0nitx-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n          In this circuit, the path of least resistance is the path in red. It flows through the led and the battery, thus the LED will light up\n\n          However, in this circuit:\n          ![](https://cloud-abtjpv714-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n          The wires cross paths and make a new path of least resistance, that does not go through the LED. This causes the led to not light up.\n        \n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n \u003cDropdown title=\"We don't want that! How can I see if I have a short circuit?\"\u003e  \n          The first thing to check for is if you have any traces(wires) that intersect or overlap, such as these 2 examples\n          ![](https://cloud-5hfwliwe8-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png) ![](https://cloud-2hhbo4z62-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n          If you don't see any of these, you should be fine. However, if you want to be extra careful, do a Design Rule Check, by going to Design -\u003e Check DRC\n          \n          Most of the errors are not actual issues, but if you click through them and find something that unsure of, consider asking around on the #Onboard channel on slack.\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\u003cDropdown title=\"I have a short circuit! How do I get rid of it?\"\u003e  \n  You should check to see if there is a different path the wire could take so it doesn't intersect, kind of like the battery and led example from above. If this is not   possible, then don't worry. This is why our board as multiple layers!\n\nThe PCB below has many shorts\n![](https://cloud-nggsler3h-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\nThe solution is to move the wire from the top layer to the bottom layer!\nFirst, select the wire you want to move\n![](https://cloud-grp5qt7qm-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\nNext, in the top right, select TopLayer, and change it to BottomLayer\n![](https://cloud-ny3wmd3c4-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\nThe wire should turn blue, or another color.\n\nThe last step is to change the pads to multilayer. First select the area where the wire and component intersect\n![](https://cloud-hzdm59xgm-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nSelect top layer, and change it to multilayer\n![](https://cloud-k7tdushgc-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nFinnally, repeat for the other pad. \n\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\nRemember to save your progress! We can check out a preview by clicking the `3D` button in the top toolbar. Hmmm... doesn't look like a business card yet. Let's add some personality to it!\n\n![](https://cloud-qega55fyl-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/2card-preview.png)\n\n## Aesthetics: Personalizing your card\n\nWe'll mostly be using the silkscreen layer to add our information and designs. Select the `TopSilkLayer` by clicking the yellow rectangle in the Layers and Objects panel. This will make sure that you're on the silkscreen layer.\n\n### Adding text\n\nIn the PCB Tools panel, select the `Text` tool. If you want to make it a business card, you can add your name and contact info -- or add any other text you want. Select the text object you just placed, and change the font, line width, and size in the right sidebar.\n\n![](https://cloud-lagxcclbp-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/8text-properties.png)\n\nDrag the text to where you want it on your board. Here, I've added my name, website, and GitHub. If you need ideas: you can add your email, phone number, or other social media handles.\n\n![](https://cloud-lagxcclbp-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/7text-added.png)\n\n### Adding a QR Code\n\nEasyEDA also supports importing images! I'll use this to add a QR Code that links to my website. I used [QRCode Monkey](https://www.qrcode-monkey.com) to generate a QR Code, then use the `File` \u003e `Import` \u003e `Image` option to import it.\n\nJust like Text objects, you can select the image to modify the properties (width, height, etc.) on the right sidebar.\n\n![](https://cloud-qega55fyl-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/6import-image.png)\n\nNote: we've been placing everything on the yellow `TopSilkLayer`. This means that they will all appear on the top side of our board. If you want to add anything to the bottom, use the green `BottomSilkLayer`! Keep in mind that the bottom layers of the board are a top-down, see through view, which is essentially flipped -- use the 3D viewer to check that all your text and images are oriented correctly.\n\n### Bonus: Textures and other effects\n\nThus far, we've only used silkscreen to add designs and text to our board. The silkscreen will show up white on the manufactured board, but it's also possible to achieve a variety of other effects by combining different layers!\n\nHere are some examples -- try incorporating these techniques into your board.\n\n- **White silkscreen**: this is what we've been using. Add things to the `TopSilkLayer` or `BottomSilkLayer` to achieve this effect.\n- **Shiny silver or gold** (depends on the finish selected when ordering): add your object to both the `TopLayer` and `TopSolderMaskLayer` (for the top of the board), or to both `BottomLayer` and `BottomSolderMaskLayer` (for the bottom of the board), and superimpose these layers on top of each other. The `TopLayer` or `BottomLayer` will put the shiny copper on your object, while the `TopSolderMaskLayer` or `BottomSolderMaskLayer` will **remove** the soldermask on the object, revealing the shiny copper underneath.\n- **Textured, or with slight color variation**: add your object to only the `TopLayer` or `BottomLayer`. Without removing the soldermask, the copper will still be covered by the soldermask, but it may slightly lighten the soldermask color and will create a textured feel.\n- **Translucent yellow** (color of the FR-4 material): add our object to only the `TopSolderMaskLayer` or `BottomSolderMaskLayer`. This will remove the soldermask on the object, revealing the yellow FR-4 material underneath. This technique is useful for allowing LEDs to shine from one side of the board to the other, or just for adding another color to your design.\n\n![](https://cloud-qega55fyl-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/7layer-effects.png)\n\n## Turn your design... into an actual card!\n\nNow that you've got an amazing design, you can actually get your card manufactured and have it in your hands in a few weeks!\n\nHack Club's [OnBoard grant](https://hackclub.com/onboard/) gives high schoolers $100 to manufacture their own PCB designs, and you can use it to get your own card manufactured.\n\n\u003e If you're in a club or afterschool group that meets for an hour you're probably reaching the end of your meeting around now. Next meeting you can get started with [the OnBoard grant tutorial](https://jams.hackclub.com/jam/onboard-grant) to order your board for manufacturing.\n\n## After receiving your PCB...\nTest out your NFC card by flashing a URL to your personal website, or your personal phone number, or even create your own NFC scavenger hunt game by encoding text to NFC.\n\n### Flashing data to NFC\nSome NFC RFID readers, such as the ones on iPhones, may have trouble reading or writing the card - this is because the card hasn't been initialized from the factory yet. To initialize the chip, start off by installing an app with the capability to use custom NFC commands, such as [NFC Tools IOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nfc-tools/id1252962749) or [NFC Tools Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wakdev.wdnfc\u0026hl=en_CA\u0026pli=1). Then, flash the NFC card with this Advanced NFC command, `A2:03:E1:10:6D:00,A2:04:03:04:D8:00,A2:05:00:00:FE:00` . This will format the chip and allow it to be written to. You can find more information about the flashing process here on [GitHub](https://github.com/Hugoyhu/NTAG-I2C-Eval-Board).\n"

When you're all done, it'll look a bit like this:\n![A demonstration of a completed platformer game](https://cloud-4p2y0vzmm-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screen_recording_2023-08-04_at_11.06.53_am.gif)\n\n## So how are we gonna do this?\nHere are the steps we'll go through to build your own game:\n1. Get started with [Glitch](https://glitch.com)\n2. Start with a simple template game\n3. Add more levels to the template\n4. Share your game!\n---\n## Get set up\nFirst, let's get started on [🎏 Glitch](https://glitch.com).\n\u003cDropdown title=\"Hey, what's Glitch?\"\u003e  \n           Glitch is a site that makes it super simple to build web apps. You can code in your browser and see your results live.\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n1. Go to [glitch.com](https://glitch.com) and click `Sign Up`.\n   ![Glitch.com's header, with an arrow pointing to the Sign Up button](https://cloud-ic6sx4m6w-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0scr-20230714-psiv-3.png)\n2. Choose how you'd like to sign up - you can use a GitHub account or a Google account, or if you don't have either, click `Email Magic Link` and you'll get a link and code in your email. \n3. Either click the link in the email or enter the code from the message in your browser.\n4. Wahoo! You're ready to code!\n---\n## Start coding\nNow, it's time to code!\n\nStart by remixing my template. Head to https://glitch.com/~kaboom-game-template, then scroll down and click `Remix your own` below the preview. Now you've got your own code editor!\n\nBefore we go any further, let's take a look at the structure of a Kaboom game.\n```js\nkaboom()\n```\nEvery Kaboom game's code will start with this - it initializes the library and gets everything set up. Here's what it looks like:\n![A blank checkerboard canvas](https://cloud-6n8dlncke-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nPretty boring. Let's get some action going!\n```js\nloadSprite(\"bean\", \"https://cdn.glitch.global/6e7edbfb-3679-4519-bb57-df3008b83592/bean.png?v=1688618964513\")\n```\nThis loads in a sprite so you can use it later. You pass in a name for the sprite (here, it's `bean`) and a URL. I've included a bunch of sample sprites in the project (check the `📦 Assets` tab in the sidebar!).\n\n```js\nadd([ \n\tsprite(\"bean\"), \n\tpos(80, 40), \n])\n```\nThis adds a sprite to the screen. \n![The same background, but now there's a frog-bean-like sprite on it](https://cloud-65jcy7vy5-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nRight now, it doesn't do much. Let's change that!\n```js\nconst bean = add([ \n\tsprite(\"bean\"), \n\tpos(80, 40), \n\tarea(),\n\tbody(),  \n]);\n```\nIn Kaboom, each *game object* is composed of multiple *components*. Each component will give the game object certain functionality.\n\n\u003e A game object is basically any character in the game, like the player character, an enemy, a rock, or a cloud.\n\nFor example, there might be a component to decide the shape of an object, whether gravity affects it, its color or even how much health it has. Let's take a deeper look at that sample:\n- The `const bean` part saves the object we're making, so we can refer to it later. You don't always need to do this, but for parts you need to use again later, it's super useful.\n- The `add()` method wraps all the components together, a bit like the tortilla of your object burrito. \n- `sprite(\"bean\")` tells Kaboom \"render this object with the `bean` sprite I loaded earlier\". \n- `pos(80, 40)` gives it a position, at X=80, Y=40.\n- `area()` gives it an area that can collide with other objects.\n- `body()` gives it a physical body, which makes it affected by gravity and lets it jump.\n\nNow, head back to your code. You'll notice I've left a comment in the code with some steps to make the game work better. Try to fill them in! If you need help with one, check below.\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"1. Making Bean more floaty\"\u003e  \n           Do you see anything that changes the world's gravity? Try changing the value there.\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\u003cDropdown title=\"2. Making coins collectible\"\u003e  \n           You might need to look at the [Kaboom docs](https://kaboomjs.com) for this one. Take a look at the methods under `Game Obj`. What looks like it does what you want?\n           For where to put it, try to find a place where _collisions_ are handled. What looks right?\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\u003cDropdown title=\"3. Make the level bigger\"\u003e  \n           There's a place in the code where the level is laid out with symbols. Can you try to add more?\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\nOnce you're done, your game should look a bit like this:\n![a screenshot of a platformer game with a wider platform and more coins](https://cloud-7rnuby5u8-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\n\u003e Psst.. here's a tip. Hit \u003ckbd\u003eF1\u003c/kbd\u003e. See all those blue boxes? Those are the collision areas of each object in your game. Now hover over one of those objects. Now you can see every object's components! It's a bit like those [x-ray specs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_specs) that there used to be ads for in comic books, but it actually works. \n\u003e \n\u003e *(Did nothing happen? If you're on macOS, hold the \u003ckbd\u003efn\u003c/kbd\u003e  key as you press F1. If you're on Windows or Linux, try toggling \u003ckbd\u003eFn Lock\u003c/kbd\u003e.)*\n---\n## Add another level!\nNow, let's add another level to our game. Find this section of the code:\n```js\nconst levels = [\n[\n// Design the level layout with symbols\n\"@  ^ $$\",\n\"=======\",\n],\n// TODO add more levels\n]\n```\nTry duplicating everything within the inner set of brackets and designing a new level! \n\u003cDropdown title=\"Done? Take a look at what it should look like.\"\u003e  \n\t   My level looked a bit like this, but you can make yours whatever you like! Notice how I added another line to the level in order to add more stuff.\n\t   ```js\nconst levels = [\n[\n// Design the level layout with symbols\n\"@  ^ $$\",\n\"=======\",\n],\n\n[\n\"  $  $   \",\n\"@        \",\n\"== == ===\",\n],\n]\n```\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\nBut how does Bean get to the next level? I'll leave this as an exercise for you. \n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"I'm a little lost, give me some steps...\"\u003e  \nHere are the general steps you'll need to do in order to do this. You can pull down any of them for some guidance. (Hint: each one corresponds to about one line of code.)\n\u003cDropdown title=\"1. Import a sprite to use for the goal\"\u003e  \n\t   Go to the `📦 Assets` tab in your project and find a sprite you want to use for the goal. Click on it and choose `Copy URL`. Then find the place in the code where we load in sprites. Add your new sprite!\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\u003cDropdown title=\"2. Add it to each level (except the last one)\"\u003e  \n\t   Remember when you added some more space to the previous level? Do that again, but use a _different_ symbol.\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\u003cDropdown title=\"3. Map the symbol you used to your sprite\"\u003e  \n\t   Now take a look at the `renderNewLevel` function in the code. This function includes a dictionary of all the sprites used in each map. Go ahead and add the portal to that dictionary! \n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\u003cDropdown title=\"4. Add some code to move to the next level\"\u003e  \n\tLook at the bottom of the code. Remember when you added code to make the coin collectable? Try to copy that for the portal. When the player hits the portal: you'll want to **increase the `levelID` counter** and **render the next level**.\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n---\n## Add more stuff!\n\nYou can also add more sprites, [some sound effects](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=audio), or even change the look of the entire game! Check out the Kaboom [docs](https://kaboomjs.com) for documentation on how to use every feature of the library, and the [playground](https://kaboomjs.com/play) for examples! \n\n\n--- \n## Sharing your game\nNow that you've made the perfect game, it's time to let others play it. Just follow these steps: (On my end, I've had issues with the \"Edit project details\" menu. This works a lot better for me.)\n1. Click `🎏 Settings` in the top left, above the file list.\n2. Click `Go to project page`\n3. On that page, click `👆 Edit details`\n4. Enter your new project name, then save it!\n5. Click the `Edit project` button to get back to coding.\n\nTo get a link that your friends can use to play your game, click the big purple `Share` button at the top, then copy the `Live site` link.\n![A screenshot of Glitch's share dialog with the \"Live site\" link highlighted](https://cloud-mmr3sh0b9-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n"

Add Your Design to Your Project Repo\n\nFrom your fork of `OnBoard`, create a folder with your project name under `OnBoard/projects`. To do this, go to the projects folder and click `Create new file`.\n\n![Projects folder](https://cloud-j2h1ajlmt-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/2projects.png)\n\n![Create new file](https://cloud-fw3ggo1g3-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0add-file.png)\n\nThen in the box labeled `name your file...`, type in `PROJECT_NAME/README.md`. This creates a README file under a folder called named after your project.\n\n![Creating a folder](https://cloud-fw3ggo1g3-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/3creating-a-folder.png)\n\nAfter this, copy and paste the contents of [`TEMPLATE.md`](./projects/!Template/TEMPLATE.md?plain=1) into the text editor and fill it out!\n\n![Paste in TEMPLATE.md](https://cloud-j2h1ajlmt-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1paste-in-template.png)\n\nOnce your done, press the big green `Commit changes` button to save!\n\nWith your README filled out, head over to add files to begin uploading your Gerber, design files, and screen shot of vendor approval.\n\n![Upload gerber files](https://cloud-fw3ggo1g3-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1adding-gerbers.png)\n\nIn all, you should have the following files under your project folder:\n- [ ] `README.md`: A filled out [`TEMPLATE.md`](./projects/!Template/TEMPLATE.md?plain=1), renamed to `README.md`.\n- [ ] `cart.png`: A screen shot of your vendor approving your board.\n- [ ] `gerber.zip`: This should be the file that you send off to the vendor.\n- [ ] Design files(`design.json`, `design.sch`, `design.brd`, etc) in `src` folder . Whatever format your designer outputs to should be included.\n- [ ] `schematic.pdf`: A pdf of your schematic, obtained from your designer.\n\n`cart.png`, `gerber.zip`, and `schematic.pdf` are all very important to be named EXACTLY that; all lowercase and with the correct file types. This helps our bot to know what they are.\n\nYour files should look roughly like this:\n\n![Ideal PR structure](https://i.imgur.com/ix7t2nJ.png)\n\nIf you have all the above, you're done with this step!\n\n## 5. Create a PR!\n\nOnce you've uploaded your files, you can merge them to the main repo through a pull request! Under the contribute tab of your forked repo, click the big green `Open pull request`.\n\n![Open a PR](https://cloud-j2h1ajlmt-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0open-pr.png)\n\nThat will bring you to the main repo, where you'll initiate a pull request. All you need to do is to follow the checklist. Then, we'll review your PR, and you'll be off to the races!\n![Submission checklist](https://cloud-j2h1ajlmt-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/4submission-checklist.png)\n\n\n## 6.

Hurry up; we have a boat to catch.\n\n---\n\nThis is a Hack Club Jam that helps you create **your very own store** on the web! You'll design everything from the products you'll sell to the colors and feel of the website. In the end, you'll get a chance to pitch your design to the workshop hosts and compete for the title of \u003cfont color=\"#7CFC00\"\u003eBest Designer\u003c/font\u003e!\n\nIf your website looks like something you would make, you did a great job 🎉\nOtherwise, go back and brainstorm ways to make your project ✨ unique ✨\n\nToday, we'll be designing our website using [**Figma**](https://figma.com/), a design tool to create functional and awesome user interfaces! If you're worried about code, don't worry. There isn't going to be any code yet, you'll have full artistic freedom after we explain Figma's features!\n\n\n\nThere are **6** important steps in this Jam! Feel free to backtrack and reference old points as you design your dream store!\n\n#### Outline:\n\n1. **Embark on your journey.** (create your first Figma file)\n2. **Open your inventory**. (learn about the tools in your hot bar \u0026 Figma structure)\n3. **Make your first painting.** (create the landing page for your store)\n4. **SO MANY DUPLICATES.** (simplify repetitive elements with components)\n5. **Make it ✨ Magical ✨** (connect your pages with interactions)\n6. **Your next adventure awaits...** (next steps)\n\nPacked your things? Let's rock this.\n\n---\n\n## Embark on your journey. 🛶\n\n\u003e You made it to your home for the next hour. Time to set up camp.\n\n### Create an Account\n\nHead over to [figma.com](https://www.figma.com/) and create an account! Afterwards, complete the onboarding portion of registration. Select the **Free** plan, and choose \"**Design with Figma**\" first.\n\nYou should be instantly booted into a new design file!\n\n![Figma New File](https://cloud-opkznq4e6-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0figma_new_file.png)\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"Not there?\"\u003e\nIf you're redirected to the dashboard instead, just click the **+ New Design File** button!\n\u003cvideo controls style={{width: \"400px\"}}\u003e \u003csource src=\"https://cloud-n2adyd9na-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0file_from_dashboard.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /\u003e\u003c/video\u003e\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\nIf you're working with a team, click the Share button in the top right and add your groupmates' emails with \"Edit\" permissions!\n\nYou're all set now! ≧(´▽｀)≦\n\n---\n\n## Open your inventory ⚒️\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"A weirdly shaped creature takes off its hood\"\u003e\nHey there. I'm Orpheus, your humble guide to Figma!\n\nWe're about to go over a lot of info, so don't worry if you forget some of it.\nI suggest you read through this section and then use it as a cheat sheet if you ever get stuck!\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\nIt _speaks_:\n\nOkay! So, let's go over the structure of the Figma editor.\n\n---\n\n![Left Sidebar](https://cloud-p4lmdd3r0-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0pasted_image_20230716011036.png)\n\n### Left Sidebar\n\nHere, you'll keep track of the current objects in your design (text, shapes, images), and be able to access assets \u0026 pages (we'll go over this later).\n\n![Toolbar](https://cloud-i2t8xhz0p-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0pasted_image_20230716011117.png)\n\n### Toolbar\n\nSituated at the top of your screen, this contains every tool you need to start designing, we'll break them down below :)).\n\n![Right Sidebar](https://cloud-i2t8xhz0p-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1pasted_image_20230716011129.png)\n\n### Right Sidebar\n\nThis section opens the properties of the currently selected layer or tool. You can edit attributes such as font size, stroke, etc., and prototype!\n\n---\n\nFigma relies on a layered system of groups. Think about it like you're stacking sheets on top of each other. Here are the main types of objects in Figma.\n\n### Frame\n\nThe foundational element for your designs is called a \"frame\"! It acts like a top-level container for your content. We normally set these to the dimensions of a target device to see what our design might look like on it.\n\n![](https://cloud-ki7xeojmd-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0frame.gif)\n\n### Group\n\nA group combines related objects together. This is a temporary union that helps reduce the number of layers that you have to work with as you design.\n\nYou can group a selection of layers together with `Ctrl + G`!\n\n![](https://cloud-8utwa7bc9-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0group.gif)\n\n### Layers\n\nLayers are the building blocks in any Figma Design. They can be anything from images, vector objects, or text. Anytime you insert an image or create a rectangle, you're making a layer!\n\n---\n\nLet's have a quick rundown of the tools we'll be using in our design.\n\nYour workshop host should have given you a cheat sheet for Figma's tools; this is your chance to read through it!\n\nYou can view the digital copy [here](https://cloud-brvsdgazn-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0figma_tools.pdf)\n\n**Phew!** That was a lot of content. Like I said earlier, feel free to come back and review :D\n\nHacker, it's time to make your first piece of art.\n\n---\n\n## Make your first painting. 🖼️\n\nBefore we start designing, we always should think about what we want to design!\n\nTake this time to think about the name of your corporation and the products you might sell. Once you've got it, continue :D\n\n---\n\nLet's give your project an awesome name! Click into the area which says \"Untitled\" and give it a name of your choosing (you can change this at any time).\n\n![Name your Project](https://cloud-4m7ljqmox-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nNext, we'll make a frame for the landing page of our website. We'll do this by clicking the hashtag-esque button on the navbar, and clicking **Desktop \u003e Macbook Pro 16\"** as our size.\n\n\u003cvideo controls style={{width: \"400px\"}}\u003e \u003csource src=\"https://cloud-hivp3jiyp-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/02023-07-15_21-19-10.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"/\u003e \u003c/video\u003e\n\nNote that you can always extend the height of the frame as you need.\n\nCan you believe it? You've created your first layer in Figma. 🎉\n\n\u003e I really love cows. In fact, I love them so much I'd like to make a business selling cow charms. I want to name it something unique and original. I GOT IT!\n\u003e\n\u003e ~ the cow charm ~\n\nInside your frame, we'll create a _text object_! Once the tool is selected, click anywhere in your frame to create a text box. You may type whatever you'd like here.\n\nwait a minute...\n![Text is too small naurr](https://cloud-6gf9bcrd6-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0pasted_image_20230716031051.png)\n\nWhat do you think we should do?\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"Hint\"\u003e\nHmm... Think back to the tools we learned about earlier, maybe something in the \"Move Tools\" section?\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\u003cDropdown title=\"Solution\"\u003e\nLuckily we can scale this up with the **Scale Tool (K)**. Scale the text to your desired size and place it where you want on the frame.\n\nWe can also select it using the **Move Tool (V)** and edit the font size in the text box's properties.\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n---\n\nLet's try adding stars to our page. We can do this by selecting the **Star Tool** and placing them as we want. If a sharp grey star isn't what I want, I can choose the _Fill Color_ and the _Corner Radius_ in the layer's properties after selecting it. In fact, I can also change the number of angles and the size of each angle of the star. If you ever want to edit some property of an object, you always check the right sidebar!\n\n\u003e Might there be some property to smite?\n\u003e Veer your eyes to the right.\n\n#### Quiz Time!\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"Try to find these properties yourself! (expand for solution)\"\u003e\n![Needed Properties](https://cloud-6fotdvxns-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0pasted_image_20230716203619_480.png)\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\nNow, I'll make the background black, text white, and change the color and size of the stars!\n![Initial background](https://cloud-rh9f8bcjk-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0pasted_image_20230718011242.png)\n\nI want the background to resemble a dark sky with a bright moon, so I'll set it to a gradient with dark shades of purple. You can find the settings of the **Fill Color**.\n\n![Gradient](https://cloud-rh9f8bcjk-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1pasted_image_20230718011436.png)\n\nIt's time to create the ✨ charm ✨! I'll make a Circle with the **Ellipse Tool** and import the images I want to use for the design.\n\n![First charm](https://cloud-rh9f8bcjk-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/2pasted_image_20230718011702.png)\n\nIt's starting to come together! It would be really awesome to have it drop down from the top of the screen, but I'm not sure how to create a string.\n\n#### Quiz Time!\n\n\u003e [!question]- What tool should I use to create the string?\n\u003e We have a lot of different choices, I could use the **Line** tool to make a simple straight string, or the **Pen** tool to create a more realistic, curvy, string.\n\u003e\n\u003e I think I'll stick with the **Line** tool, thanks for your help!\n\nThis is cool, but something seems a bit off.\n![String](https://cloud-rh9f8bcjk-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/3pasted_image_20230718012123.png)\n\nThere isn't a hole for the string to go through!! It would be easy to just use another circle to indicate the hole, but the gradient background makes it hard to replicate.\n\nIf only, we could cut a hole in the circle...\n\n**WAIT NEVERMIND WE CAN YAYAYAYA**\n\nLet's first create a circle to designate the hole, and then select both the charm and the circle destined to be a hole on top of it.\n\n![Circle](https://cloud-rh9f8bcjk-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/4pasted_image_20230718012451.png)\n\nAt the top of your screen, you'll see an icon that looks like two overlapping rectangles; click that!\n\n![Boolean operators](https://cloud-rh9f8bcjk-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/5pasted_image_20230718012524.png)\n\nThese are Figma's boolean operators!! 😍😍\n\nYou have four options:\n\n1. Union selection.\n   - Merges two layers together. If the objects overlap, then the shape's outline consists of it's sublayers, not including segments that overlap.\n   - Think of it as a bitwise OR operator — `A | B`\n2. Subtract selection.\n   - Removes a layer's intersection (and itself!) from another layer. This is the opposite of a union.\n   - Think of it as `A \u0026 ~B`.\n3. Intersect selection.\n   - Removes everything but the intersection between the two.\n   - Think of it as a bitwise AND operator — `A \u0026 B`\n4. Exclude selection.\n   1. Keeps everything except the intersection between the two.\n   2. Think of it as a bitwise XOR operator — `A ^ B`\n\n\u003e [!question]- Which one do we need?\n\u003e The **Subtract** boolean operator! We want to remove the smaller circle from the larger one.\n\u003e\n\u003e Awesome! Now we'll select both and perform that operation:\n\u003e ![Subtract](https://cloud-rh9f8bcjk-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/6pasted_image_20230718112359.png)\n\nIt's starting to look more and more like a charm!\n![Charm](https://cloud-rh9f8bcjk-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/7pasted_image_20230718112519.png)\n\nNow, I'll add some decorations and drop shadow, and we'll have a completed element!\n\n![Charm with effects](https://cloud-rh9f8bcjk-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/8pasted_image_20230718112914.png)\n\nIf I have multiple layers that I want to fit into a circle, I can use Figma's **Mask** tool!\n![Mask select](https://cloud-rh9f8bcjk-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/9pasted_image_20230718113841.png)\n_Here, I've created a new circle to use as the frame and selected all the layers I want to be inside of it!_\n\nThis tool allows you to use a layer as a \"cutout\" for another, and we can even adjust it after masking!\n\nHere's the result:\n![Masked layers](https://cloud-f6y742j59-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0pasted_image_20230718114047.png)\n\nNow, we'll place in a product image (ill use the mockup we designed earlier).\n![Background + Product](https://cloud-rgpmdor1b-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1pasted_image_20230722221003.png)\n_To make the background stars, I created 4 stars and dropped the opacity to ~60%_\n\nFrom here, I can add some text using the **Text Tool (T)**, setting its fill color to whatever I want.\n\n![With Text](https://cloud-rgpmdor1b-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/2pasted_image_20230722221229.png)\n\nAwesome! I'll create a couple more to create a grid-like format.\n\n![Few more!](https://cloud-rgpmdor1b-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/3pasted_image_20230722221310.png)\n\nAs you might have guessed, the footer will also be the same; we'll use a rectangle as a background:\n![Step 1](https://cloud-rgpmdor1b-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/4pasted_image_20230722221404.png)\n\nAdd in star shapes with the **Star Tool** and add our logo!\n![Step 2](https://cloud-rgpmdor1b-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/5pasted_image_20230722221434.png)\n\nAfter that, it's up to us to add whatever information we think is necessary. I'll add a privacy \u0026 terms page and a contact us page :D\n\n![Step 3](https://cloud-rgpmdor1b-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/6pasted_image_20230722221519.png)\n\nTry creating the Navbar by yourself :)\n\n---\n\nLooks like you've got the hang of it! Remember to look back at the tool cheat sheet from earlier and start to build out your store.\n\nHere are the pages you should build out **right now**:\n\n1. **Landing Page** (add your own creative splash on this!)\n2. **About Page**\n3. **Product Listing Page** (can be on the landing page)\n4. **Product Pages** (for each one you sell)\n\nTo make these, you can create separate frames for each page.\n\nGood luck hacker! We'll see you on the other side.\n\n---\n\n## SO MANY DUPLICATES 😱\n\nWhile you were designing your pages, you may have realized how many reused components are on each page. So, if you wanted to add an extra button or link, you had to go through every single page and edit it.\n\nFear not, Figma has a wonderful tool called: **Assets**!\n\nThese are layers that reference another layer instead of having its own value. If you are familiar with pointers and references, these are basically the same thing.\n\n### Layer\n\n![Layer Animation](https://cloud-faklou4uh-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0color-scheme-_remix_.gif)\n\n### Asset\n\n![Asset Animation](https://cloud-ghmaoucif-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0color-scheme-_remix___1_.gif)\n\nFirst, we'll create a new page so that we have our final prototype in one place. We can do this by expanding the \"Page\" icon on the left sidebar and clicking the '+' icon when it appears. Name this page **Assets**.\n\nNow, we'll copy over the elements that we want to turn into components.\n\n![Copied Elements](https://cloud-e1j5bcew3-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0pasted_image_20230717003414.png)\n\nNow, select the entire asset, right-click, and select \"**Create Component**\"\n\n![Create Component](https://cloud-e1j5bcew3-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1pasted_image_20230717003457.png)\n\nDo the same for every other asset you want to create. You'll know you've done it correctly if they appear purple in the left sidebar.\n\n![Component layers](https://cloud-e1j5bcew3-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/2pasted_image_20230717003601.png)\n\nWhen you open the **Assets** tab in the left sidebar, you'll get the chance to drag it into your project!\n\n![Asset sidebar](https://cloud-e1j5bcew3-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/3pasted_image_20230717003648.png)\n\nYou did it hacker!\n\n## Make it ✨ Magical ✨\n\nWell, we have our pages, but it doesn't feel right. What's missing?\n\nRight. It just feels like we're scrolling through images. Let's make this an actual prototype.\n\nYou might have noticed a **Prototype** tab in the right sidebar; this tab helps us make interactions by clicking different areas of the page.\n\nFor example, if we click an element on our **About** page, we'll get options to create an interaction.\n\n![Prototype tab](https://cloud-e1j5bcew3-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/4pasted_image_20230717004550.png)\n\nLet's try that!\n![Interaction](https://cloud-e1j5bcew3-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/5pasted_image_20230717004607.png)\n\nFor now, we'll just use the **On Click** trigger with the **Navigate to** response. This gives us a list of frames in our project we can jump to:\n![Navigate to?](https://cloud-e1j5bcew3-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/6pasted_image_20230717004656.png)\n\nSelect the one you want and customize the transition!\np.s. for similar pages (such as your product page), it might be more intuitive for a \"**Smart Animate**\" transition.\n\nFor example, I set the transition between the home and about page to \"**Smart Animate**\", and this is the result:\n![Animation Preview](https://cloud-h7lkfzs4c-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/02023-07-18_11-49-28.gif)\n\n**Follow the same technique for every single clickable element!**\n\n---\n\nOnce you're finished, click the present icon on the top right corner (looks like a play button) and enjoy the show! Make sure you're on the final prototype page and not the assets page!\n\nSplendid! Here are my interactions in my example design:\n![Final prototype](https://cloud-e1j5bcew3-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/7pasted_image_20230717005112.png)\n\nHopefully, your design looks totally unique and different!\n\nGet ready to pitch it to the hosts... 🍿\n\n## Up for a challenge?\n\nThere's a really awesome tool in your toolbar that I haven't mentioned.\n![Plugins?!](https://cloud-e1j5bcew3-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/8pasted_image_20230717005231.png)\n\nThe **Plugins** tab :00\n\nIt's a community-run store with a lot of amazing pre-made components/tools to help with your Figma design.\n\nFeel free to browse through and find something awesome for your design. One that I thought was really cool is called \"_MeshFlow Gradients_\".\n\n## Your next adventure.\n\n\nIf you'd like to implement this prototype into a working website, check out the jam \"**Wielding the Elemental Magic of the Web (not evil)**\" to figure out how to implement your design in HTML and CSS! Also, try enabling \"**Dev Mode**\" in Figma (a switch on the top right corner) to see property values in CSS and example code for some objects!\n\nIt's been a blast jamming out with you!

Along the way, you'll learn a little bit about:\n\n- how to use p5.js\n- some basic physics concepts\n- how _fun_ creative coding is\n\nAll of the different particles will act like planets in orbit. They'll all apply forces (gravity) to each other depending on their mass and their distance from each other. The main difference here is that they are much closer together than real planets. This is so you don't have to wait an entire year for one particle to orbit another.\n\nWhen you are done with this workshop, you should end up with something similar to this!\n\n[![Final product](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/588608bd77901d32e460818794b2832627e4a785d69bee0821115166d7be3a1b/68747470733a2f2f636c6f75642d6f64646a696971356b2e76657263656c2e6170702f3073756d6d6172792e676966)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/588608bd77901d32e460818794b2832627e4a785d69bee0821115166d7be3a1b/68747470733a2f2f636c6f75642d6f64646a696971356b2e76657263656c2e6170702f3073756d6d6172792e676966)\n\nThis workshop should take 30-45 minutes to complete.\n\n## Getting Set Up\n\nFirst you need to setup your project. I created a basic p5.js [boilerplate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_code) that you can use to easily start coding.\n\n1. Go to [https://repl.it/@SquarePear/p5-boilerplate](https://repl.it/@SquarePear/p5-boilerplate)\n2. Click \"fork\" to make a copy for you to edit\n\n## Making a Particle\n\nThe first step in this project is to create a class to manage the particles. Before you can do this, you should create a new file to store the class for easier readability.\n\n1. Create a new file called `particle.js`\n2. Add this file in between the `\u003cbody\u003e` `\u003c/body\u003e` tags of the `index.html` file:\n\n```html\n...\n\u003cbody\u003e\n  \u003cscript src=\"particle.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n  \u003cscript src=\"sketch.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n\u003c/body\u003e\n...\n```\n\n3. Add the class definition to `particle.js`\n\n```js\nclass Particle {}\n```\n\nA [class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)) is just a way of connecting a set of variables and functions in one package. Now that you have a particle class, you need to define what the particle can do.\n\nInside your newly-created `Particle` class, add:\n\n```js\nclass Particle {\n  constructor (x, y, mass) {\n    // Setup particle\n  }\n\n  draw() {\n    // Draw particle\n  }\n\n  applyForce(force) {\n    // Apply force to particle\n  }\n\n  physics(particle) {\n    // Use particle\n  }\n\n  update() {\n    // Update particle\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe just added a list of functions that objects of this class can perform. With the basic structure set up, lets go through each function individually and add the code.\n\n```js\n...\nconstructor(x, y, mass) {\n  this.position = createVector(x, y)\n  this.acceleration = createVector(0, 0)\n  this.velocity = createVector(0, 0)\n  this.mass = mass\n\n  // radius = (mass / π) ** 0.5\n  this.radius = Math.sqrt(this.mass / PI) * SCALE\n  // set random color for particle\n  this.color = color(random(0, 255), random(0, 255), random(0, 255))\n}\n...\n```\n\nThe [constructor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructor_(object-oriented_programming)) is used to create an instance of a class. In this case, we use it to set up all of the variables when we make a new particle. The [`createVector()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/createVector) function is provided by p5 to easily make a [vector object](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Vector). This is just a 2d line or position with a few helper functions to easily modify the values.\n\nNext, let's add the code for drawing the particle.\n\n```js\n...\ndraw() {\n  // Remove outline\n  noStroke()\n  // Set fill to particles color\n  fill(this.color)\n  // Draw particle\n  ellipse(this.position.x, this.position.y, this.radius * 2)\n}\n...\n```\n\nThis one is much simpler. All this function does it set the color using the [`fill()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/fill) function and then draws the particle using p5's [`ellipse()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/ellipse) function.\n\nNext, let's add the code for applying force to the particle.\n\n```js\n...\napplyForce(force) {\n  // acceleration = force / mass\n  this.acceleration.add(p5.Vector.div(force, this.mass))\n}\n...\n```\n\nHere we see the first physics formula. This calculates how much acceleration the object should have based on the force applied. We use [Newton's second law of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion#Constant_Mass)—`F=ma` or `Force = mass * acceleration`— to calculate this acceleration.\n\nNext, let's add the code for applying real-world physics to a particle.\n\n```js\n...\nphysics(particle) {\n  // Don't apply to self\n  if (this === particle) return\n\n  // mass1 * mass2\n  let mass = this.mass * particle.mass\n  // radius1 + radius2\n  let radius = this.radius + particle.radius\n  // Distance between particles\n  let distance = this.position.dist(particle.position)\n\n  // Don't apply if particles are touching\n  if (distance \u003c= radius) return\n\n  // force = G * mass1 * mass2 / distance ** 2\n  let force = p5.Vector.sub(this.position, particle.position)\n    .setMag(G * mass  / (distance ** 2))\n\n  // Apply the force\n  particle.applyForce(force)\n}\n...\n```\n\nThis one looks complicated, but if you think about it in terms of physics it is actually surprisingly simple.\n\n- The first line is just making sure it isn't trying to compare itself.\n- Next, we declare a few variables.\n- The second if statement is just used to stop the forces when the particles are colliding. This isn't 100% necessary, but things will probably break if they get too close.\n- The `force` variable points from the affected particle to the affecter.\n- Next the magnitude is set to the amount of force using the [gravitational formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation).\n- Finally, the force is applied to the particle.\n\nFinall y, let's write some code for updating the properties of the particle:\n\n```js\n...\nupdate() {\n  let deltaVelocity = p5.Vector.mult(this.acceleration, deltaTime)\n\n  this.velocity.set(this.velocity.add(deltaVelocity))\n\n  this.position.set(this.position.add(p5.Vector.mult(this.velocity, deltaTime)))\n\n  this.acceleration.set(0, 0)\n}\n...\n```\n\nThis might also look a bit intimidating at first, but if you break it down into sections it is much easier to understand.\n\n- The first line just calculates the change in acceleration. [`deltaTime`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/deltaTime) is used to keep the forces constant no matter how many frames per second you are getting.\n- The next line adds the acceleration to the velocity.\n- Then the velocity is added to the position, again using `deltaTime` to keep constant changes.\n- Finally you reset the acceleration to zero. The velocity stays because of momentum.\n\nYay! You set up the Particle class! Now you can go back to the main sketch and set up the particle management.\n\n## Managing the Particles\n\nOpen the `sketch.js` file in the left sidebar. Right now the code should look like this:\n\n```js\nfunction setup () {\n  createCanvas(400, 400)\n}\n\nfunction draw () {\n  background(51, 51, 51)\n}\n```\n\nThe [`setup()`](https://github.com/hackclub/hackclub/blob/main/workshops/particle_physics) function is run once at the beginning of the program to do any setup you might need. We use it to create the canvas using [`createCanvas()`](https://github.com/hackclub/hackclub/blob/main/workshops/particle_physics). This creates a 400x400 pixel canvas for us to draw on.\n\nThe [`draw()`](https://github.com/hackclub/hackclub/blob/main/workshops/particle_physics) function is run every frame of the program. This can be used to update the animation every frame. We will use it to perform the the physics updates and draw the particles to the canvas.\n\nThis file is where we're going to write all the program logic, from creating the `Particle`s we just wrote, to applying physics to them and animating them.\n\nFirst, we will create the array of particles we will be displaying. Then we need to update and display them every frame inside `draw()`.\n\nFirst, we need to set some constants and cerate an array of particles we will be displaying. Above the `setup()` function, at the beginning of the file, add:\n\n```js\n// Constants\nconst G = 6.67e-11\nconst SCALE = 0.001\n\n// Array to store particles\nlet particles = []\n```\n\nIn physics, `G` refers to the [Gravitational Constant](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant), which is 6.67 x 10-11 N⋅m2⋅kg-2 (which we'll write as 6.67e-11 in JS). This constant is used as the basis for all sorts of fun equations.\n\nNow, let's set up our canvas. In the `setup()` function, add:\n\n```js\nfunction setup() {\n  createCanvas(400, 400)\n\n  // Loop and create each particles\n  for (let i = 0; i \u003c 10; i++) {\n    let x = random(0, width)\n    let y = random(0, height)\n    let mass = random(2e8, 1e9)\n\n    // Add the new particle to the list\n    particles.push(new Particle(x, y, mass))\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAll we're doing in the `setup()` function is creating a random location on the canvas, as well as a random mass, for the particle. Then, we create a new `Particle` with this data and add it it to the array of particles we just created.\n\nAll of the building blocks are in place. Finally, we're going to use the `draw()` function to animate the particles we created according to the rules of physics. In the `draw()` function, add:\n\n```js\nfunction draw() {\n  // Set the background of the canvas to a dark gray\n  background(51, 51, 51)\n\n  // Loop all particles twice\n  for (const particleA of particles)\n    for (const particleB of particles)\n      if (particleA !== particleB) particleA.physics(particleB)\n\n  // Loop particles again\n  for (const particle of particles) {\n    // Update the particle with the new acceleration and velocity\n    particle.update()\n    // Draw the particle on the canvas\n    particle.draw()\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- First, we set the background of our canvas to a dark gray\n- Then, we loop through the array of particles twice. If the two particles in the nested for loop are different, we use the `physics()` function we wrote earlier to apply physics to them\n- After that, we loop through the array of particles again and update each `Particle` object with the new data as a result of running `physics` on the particles.\n- And finally, to see the changes, we draw the particle.\n\nWe're going through this slowly and step-by-step, but don't forget that because all of thise code is in the `draw()` function, it's run dozens (sometimes hundreds) of times per second. This is how the smooth animation that you'll see in a second is created.\n\nHere's the final sketch.js code:\n\n## You're Finished!\n\nClick the green \"Run\" button at the top of the page. You should see some colorful particles movine!\n\nAnd with that, you should now have a working—although very basic—simulation of gravity between particles. This simulation is roughly what would happen in real life with these exact masses and distances. The values themselves are a bit over exaggerated to be more visually interesting.\n\n- [Final Code](https://repl.it/@SquarePear/Particle-Physics#sketch.js)\n- [Final Project](https://particle-physics.squarepear.repl.co/)\n\n## What to Do Next?\n\nTry changing some values and see how they affect the simulation. Add some extra features like creating a particle on click, anti-particles, or maybe apply this concept in a whole different way?\n\n1.

There’s something surreal and indescribably satisfying about _seeing_ the sounds around you on your screen and somehow understanding what you’re seeing.\n\n[![Colorful particles traveling vertically down the screen](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ae14331c08ceff647994cdce13fb4a2247c4eca77b5f0c4ac36de966cda3c790/68747470733a2f2f636c6f75642d6d746f736c726739722d6861636b2d636c75622d626f742e76657263656c2e6170702f3266696e616c2d64656d6f2e676966)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ae14331c08ceff647994cdce13fb4a2247c4eca77b5f0c4ac36de966cda3c790/68747470733a2f2f636c6f75642d6d746f736c726739722d6861636b2d636c75622d626f742e76657263656c2e6170702f3266696e616c2d64656d6f2e676966)\n\nIn this workshop, you’re going to create a galaxy out of shimmering particles that expand and move based on microphone input, in less than 50 lines of code.\n\n[Final code](https://sound-galaxy--techbug2012.repl.co/)\n[Final demo](https://sound-galaxy-1.sahitid.repl.co/)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nWe’re going to be using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), a JavaScript library for creative coding, to make this project. This project requires two separate p5.js libraries: `p5.js` and `p5.sound.js`.\n\nGet started from the starter project by [clicking here](https://repl.it/@TechBug2012/sound-galaxy-starter). Once your project spins up, navigate to the `index.html` file. Then, just before the end of your `\u003chead\u003e` tag, import these two libraries:\n\n```html\n\u003cscript src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/p5@1.0.0/lib/p5.min.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n\u003cscript src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/p5@1.0.0/lib/addons/p5.sound.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n```\n\nGreat! Now that we’ve imported p5, we’re ready to start writing JavaScript.\n\n## About the Fourier Transform\n\nAt the center of everything we’re building in this workshop is something called a Fourier Transform: a mathematical operation that takes a frequency (e.g. the sound frequency picked up by your computer’s microphone) and decomposes it into the individual wavelengths that make it up. You don’t need to understand how the Fourier Transform works—it’s built into p5 and super easy to use—but if you’re interested, 3Blue1Brown made [a great video](https://youtu.be/spUNpyF58BY) explaining it.\n\n## Setting Up p5\n\np5.js is primarily composed of two functions: `setup()` and `draw()`. The `setup()` function runs only once when the project first starts up, and the `draw()` function runs continuously afterwards. Let’s start by creating these two functions in your `script.js` file:\n\n```js\nfunction setup() {}\n\nfunction draw() {}\n```\n\nEverything in p5.js happens on a p5 canvas. Let’s create a canvas that fills our window in the `setup()` function:\n\n```js\nfunction setup() {\n  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight)\n  noStroke()\n}\n```\n\nBy default, p5 adds an outline around objects in a canvas. `noStroke()` removes this outline.\n\nNow, let’s tell p5 to listen for microphone input.\n\n```js\nfunction setup() {\n  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight)\n  noStroke()\n\n  let mic = new p5.AudioIn()\n  mic.start()\n}\n```\n\nNext, let’s initialize p5’s Fast Fourier Transform algorithm. We’ll be using this throughout the project, so we want to declare it globally and initialize it in the `setup()` function:\n\n```js\nlet fft\n\nfunction setup() {\n  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight)\n  noStroke()\n\n  let mic = new p5.AudioIn()\n  mic.start()\n\n  fft = new p5.FFT()\n  fft.setInput(mic)\n}\n\nfunction draw() {}\n```\n\n## Creating a Particle\n\nWe’re almost ready to start drawing—but as of now, we don’t have anything to draw! Let’s create a Particle object and give it some basic properties. Above the `setup()` function, add:\n\n```js\nlet Particle = function (position) {}\n```\n\nThis is how [objects](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_objects.asp) are created in JavaScript. If we want to create a new Particle, we would use `let particle = new Particle()`.\n\nWe want to give the Particle object a standard set of properties that can be changed for each instance of a Particle. For now, let’s start with `position`, `speed`, and `color`—but think of some other properties that your particles can have!\n\n```js\nlet Particle = function (position) {\n  this.position = position\n  this.speed = createVector(0, 1)\n  this.color = [random(0, 255), random(0, 255), random(0, 255)]\n}\n```\n\nHere, we’re setting:\n\n- `position` to a position given to the Particle when it’s created\n- `speed` to 0 in the x direction and 1 in the y direction\n- `color` to a random [RGB](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_rgb.asp) color.\n\nNow that we've created our Particle object, let’s create a bunch of particles and randomly distribute them across our screen. The starter project you started with comes with a handy `galaxyManager`, which gives you a few functions to easily manage your galaxy with. The `positionParticles()` function creates an array of 1024 particles at random places on your screen. Let's add this function to the bottom of `setup()`.\n\n```js\nfunction setup() {\n  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight)\n  noStroke()\n\n  let mic = new p5.AudioIn()\n  mic.start()\n\n  fft = new p5.FFT()\n  fft.setInput(mic)\n\n  positionParticles()\n}\n```\n\n## Drawing Particles\n\nBefore we can draw our particles, we need to think about what “drawing” a particle even means. As of now, a “particle” is just an abstract idea that we made up. We've given it certain properties, but we haven't used these properties anywhere.\n\nLet’s go back to our `Particle` object and write a [method](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_methods.asp) that gives instructions for drawing a particle.\n\n```js\nlet Particle = function (position) {\n  this.position = position\n  this.speed = createVector(0, 1)\n  this.color = [random(0, 255), random(0, 255), random(0, 255)]\n\n  this.draw = function () {\n    circle(this.position.x, this.position.y, this.diameter)\n    fill(this.color)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe `draw` method that we just added creates a circle at the `x` and `y` coordinates of the particle and fills it with the color assigned to it. Now, instead of being an abstract idea, a Particle is a randomly-colored circle.\n\nNow, if we wanted to draw a Particle called `awesomeParticle` at the top left corner of the screen, we could do it with `awesomeParticle.draw()`.\n\nNow that our particles are real objects, we can finally draw them on our canvas! In the p5 `draw()` function (the function under `setup()`, not the method you just created), add:\n\n```js\nfunction draw() {\n  drawParticles()\n}\n```\n\n`drawParticles()` is another function offered by the galaxy manager that calls the `draw` method on every instantiated particle.\n\nIf you run your repl now, you should see this:\n\n[![Colorful particles randomly scattered on a white canvas](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/99375510ad5585041cb8773b1a241210216f11b31e5f3fc28552c065b2bf7999/68747470733a2f2f636c6f75642d6d746f736c726739722d6861636b2d636c75622d626f742e76657263656c2e6170702f31647261772e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/99375510ad5585041cb8773b1a241210216f11b31e5f3fc28552c065b2bf7999/68747470733a2f2f636c6f75642d6d746f736c726739722d6861636b2d636c75622d626f742e76657263656c2e6170702f31647261772e706e67)\nNice! We've just given life to our particles! If you want to make your canvas look more like space, you can add\n\n```js\nbackground(0, 0, 0)\n```\n\nto your `draw()` function to make the background black.\n\n```js\nfunction draw() {\n  background(0, 0, 0)\n  drawParticles()\n}\n```\n\n## Updating Particles\n\nWe have one more problem: the particles don’t move or change at all! Currently, they’re just being drawn according to the properties we gave them earlier. Let’s put the Fast Fourier Transform to use and make our particles update according to the microphone input.\n\nJust like for drawing particles, we need to set instructions for what “updating” a particle means via a method. Under the `draw` method in the `Particle` object, add\n\n```js\nthis.update = function (energy) {}\n```\n\nWe’re passing in an `energy`, which is the intensity of sound at each part of the FFT spectrum. In our case, this means the intensity of each particle.\n\nThere are endless ways to update a particle based on intensity of sound, but here’s what I personally came up with:\n\n```js\nthis.update = function (energy) {\n  this.diameter = random(5, 7) + energy * 100\n  this.position.y += this.speed.y * energy * 10\n  if (this.position.y \u003e height) {\n    this.position.y = 0\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis makes the particles shimmer (like stars in a galaxy), updates the diameter and speed based on sound intensity, and resets each particle to the top of the screen once they reach the bottom of the screen to make it look like a continuous stream of particles.\n\nThis is where you shine! Play around with these numbers, think of other ways to update the particles—don’t walk out of this meeting with this block of code unchanged!\n\nNow that we’ve given instructions for updating a particle, we can finally put the Fast Fourier Transform to use and continuously draw updated particles! In the `draw()` function, remove `drawParticles()` and replace it with these two lines:\n\n```js\nlet spectrum = fft.analyze()\nupdateParticles(spectrum)\n```\n\nThis runs p5’s Fast Fourier Transform algorithm and updates each particle accordingly using another handy function from the galaxy manager.\n\nCongratulations! You did it! Here’s what your entire `script.js` file should now look like:\n\n```js\nlet fft\n\nlet Particle = function (position) {\n  this.position = position\n  this.speed = createVector(0, 1)\n  this.color = [random(0, 255), random(0, 255), random(0, 255)]\n  this.draw = function () {\n    circle(this.position.x, this.position.y, this.diameter)\n    fill(this.color)\n  }\n  this.update = function (energy) {\n    this.position.y += this.speed.y * energy * 10\n    if (this.position.y \u003e height) {\n      this.position.y = 0\n    }\n    this.diameter = random(5, 7) + energy * 100\n  }\n}\n\nfunction setup() {\n  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight)\n  noStroke()\n\n  let mic = new p5.AudioIn()\n  mic.start()\n\n  fft = new p5.FFT()\n  fft.setInput(mic)\n\n  positionParticles()\n}\n\nfunction draw() {\n  background(0, 0, 0)\n  let spectrum = fft.analyze()\n  updateParticles(spectrum)\n}\n```\n\nRun your repl now, then **open it in a new window** by clicking the window button at the top right corner. Make sure the page has access to your microphone, then click once on the screen. You should start seeing a shimmering galaxy that you can control with your voice!\n\n## Hacking\n\nThere are endless ways to make this project completely your own! Go back through your code and look for anything that can be played with. Try changing the default values of your Particles, playing with the numbers in the `update` method, and think of ways you can add to this to make it even better!\n\nHere are some examples of projects that stem from this project but take it even further:\n\n- **Raining particles**: [Demo](https://observant-wild-sunspot.glitch.me/) [Code](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/observant-wild-sunspot)\n- **Raining particles 2**: [Demo](https://icy-married-crabapple.glitch.me/) [Code](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/icy-married-crabapple)\n- **Using mp3 files as input**: [Demo](https://sound-viz-song-2--techbug2012.repl.co/) [Code](https://repl.it/@TechBug2012/sound-viz-song-2)"

Because these are long URLs, just replace the file with this:\n\n```html\n\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e\n\u003chtml\u003e\n  \u003chead\u003e\n    \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\" /\u003e\n    \u003ctitle\u003eSpeak a Color\u003c/title\u003e\n    \u003cscript src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/p5@1.0.0/lib/p5.min.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n    \u003cscript src=\"https://rawcdn.githack.com/IDMNYU/p5.js-speech/e7ae007d61f048fc2379971b0de7d5db8abb7eee/lib/p5.speech.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n  \u003c/head\u003e\n  \u003cbody\u003e\n    \u003cscript src=\"script.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n  \u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\nBut never copy \u0026 paste code without reading it 🙂\n\n- We’re initializing an HTML page\n- We’re giving it a `\u003ctitle\u003e`, which appears as the tab name in your browser\n- We’re linking the two external libraries we need\n- Finally, a link to the `script.js` file we’ll write our own JavaScript code in\n\nThe rest of the code samples in this workshop will all be for `script.js`, where we write the p5 code.\n\n## Displaying instructions\n\nFirst, we need to set up a canvas with p5.\n\n- We want the canvas to fill the screen, so p5's `windowWidth` \u0026 `windowHeight` come in handy.\n- Let’s go ahead \u0026 fill the background with white, and make the text color dark grey.\n\n```js\nfunction setup() {\n  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight)\n  background(255)\n  fill(25)\n}\n```\n\nThe page still looks empty, oops! Let’s add some initial instructions, even though they won’t do anything yet.\n\n(You only need the `text()` line here—you can omit the `textSize`, `textAlign` etc—but these other lines make the text more fun-looking. Feel free to change the size or font!)\n\n```js\nfunction setup() {\n  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowWidth)\n  background(255)\n  fill(25)\n\n  textSize(48)\n  textAlign(CENTER)\n  textStyle(BOLDITALIC)\n  textFont('\"Avenir Next\", system-ui, sans-serif')\n  text('SAY A COLOR', width / 2, height / 2)\n}\n```\n\nFantastic! Up next: the speech recognition we came here for.\n\n## Running speech recognition\n\nThe p5.speech library has [an example](https://github.com/IDMNYU/p5.js-speech/blob/master/examples/05continuousrecognition.html) of \"continuous\" speech recognition—that is, the mic stays active after you’ve said your first phrase, instead of being one-time.\n\nLet’s set up continuous speech recognition, and display an alert when new speech is transcribed:\n\n```js\nconst speech = new p5.SpeechRec('en-US', parseResult)\nspeech.continuous = true\nspeech.interimResults = false\n\nfunction setup() {\n  // …\n  text('SAY A COLOR', width / 2, height / 2)\n  speech.start()\n}\n\nfunction draw() {\n  // Where we’re going we don’t need drawing\n}\n\nfunction parseResult() {\n  if (speech.resultValue) {\n    alert(speech.resultString)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe’re getting there…\n\n## Changing the color\n\nBecause HTML/CSS support a wide array of [named colors](https://html-color-codes.info/color-names/), we’re going to use those for this project. (You can read more about [where the color names come from](https://www.chenhuijing.com/blog/where-did-css-named-colours-come-from/), or if you want to extend this project, figure out how to use [JavaScript objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) to support your own colors!)\n\nFor the first iteration, we’re just supporting single-word colors, because it’s simplest.\n\n- We’re starting with the `speech.resultString`, which we used before.\n- To get the last word:\n    - We’ll do [`.split(' ')`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split), which converts the text into a [JavaScript array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) of words: `'hello there friend'.split(' ')` is `['hello', 'there', 'friend']`\n    - `.pop()` then gets the last item from the array, which is the last word as a string\n- Finally, because we want all text on the site to be in all-caps, we’ll add `.toUpperCase()`\n- These function calls can all be chained next to each other!\n\n```js\n// …\nfunction parseResult() {\n  if (speech.resultValue) {\n    alert(speech.resultString.split(' ').pop().toUpperCase())\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSpectacular! Now let’s set the background color to the color, and write it onscreen.\n\n```js\n// …\nfunction parseResult() {\n  if (speech.resultValue) {\n    const color = speech.resultString.split(' ').pop().toUpperCase()\n    background(color)\n    text(color, width / 2, height / 2)\n    console.log(color)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- Because we need to use the color name in multiple places, we’re setting it to a variable, so that we don’t have to do the whole split/pop/upperCase things multiple times.\n- Setting the background is as simple as `background(color)`. Thanks, p5!\n- Adding the text onscreen works just the way the instructions did. Because we want it centered horizontally \u0026 vertically, we set the x coordinate to `width / 2` (so the midpoint of the width of the canvas), \u0026 the y to `height / 2` (same for canvas height).\n- The `console.log` line is totally optional, but it allows you to see what’s being transcribed in your [DevTools JavaScript console](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/log).\n\n## Wrapping up\n\nThat’s it! Here’s the whole `script.js` file:\n\n```js\nconst speech = new p5.SpeechRec('en-US', parseResult)\nspeech.continuous = true\nspeech.interimResults = false\n\nfunction setup() {\n  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight)\n  background(255)\n  fill(25)\n\n  textSize(48)\n  textAlign(CENTER)\n  textStyle(BOLDITALIC)\n  textFont('\"Avenir Next\", system-ui, sans-serif')\n  text('SAY A COLOR', width / 2, height / 2)\n  speech.start()\n}\n\nfunction draw() {\n  // Where we’re going we don’t need drawing\n}\n\nfunction parseResult() {\n  if (speech.resultValue) {\n    const color = speech.resultString.split(' ').pop().toUpperCase()\n    background(color)\n    text(color, width / 2, height / 2)\n    console.log(color)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nA few ideas to take this further:\n\n- Support multi-word color names. Hint: instead of getting the last word, maybe figure out how to remove the spaces?\n- As aforementioned, support your own colors 👀\n- Keep track of all the colors, maybe show them all simultaneously?"

                  "content": "\nOne of the most common myths about coding among people who are first learning to code is that coding mostly consists of sitting in a dark room all day writing algorithms in a black terminal window with green text, solving complex mathematical equations, and generally being a genius.\n\nYou’re going to crush this myth in this workshop by making crazy, colorful splatter paint right in your web browser, in only 20 minutes.\n\n![Colorful patterns of dots and lines on a canvas](https://cloud-3aosybiuc-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1final-demo.png)\n\n[Final code](https://repl.it/@TechBug2012/splatter-paint#index.html)\n[Final demo](https://splatter-paint.techbug2012.repl.co)\n\n## Getting started\n\nStart by creating a new HTML project on repl.it by going to [repl.it/languages/html](https://repl.it/languages/html).\n\nWe’re going to be using a library called [Paper.js](http://paperjs.org), which makes it easy to create cool visuals on an [HTML canvas](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp).\n\nTo import a JavaScript library in HTML, we use the `\u003cscript\u003e` tag and include a link to the library we want to import. For Paper.js, this looks like:\n\n```html\n\u003cscript src=\"https://unpkg.com/paper@0.11.5/dist/paper-full.min.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n```\n\nAdd a script tag that imports Paper.js somewhere in the `\u003chead\u003e`. Then, directly under it, add the following:\n\n```html\n\u003cscript\n  type=\"text/paperscript\"\n  canvas=\"splatterPaint\"\n  src=\"/script.js\"\n\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n```\n\nLet’s go over what each attribute of this tag does:\n\n1. `type=\"text/paperscript\"` tells Paper.js that the code in the script is Paper.js code\n2. `canvas=\"splatterPaint\"` refers to the ID of the HTML canvas that Paper.js will operate on (we haven’t created this canvas yet, but we will in a second)\n3. `src=\"/script.js\"` means that the content of this script is located in your `script.js` file\n\nRemember when we referred to a canvas called `splatterPaint` that hasn’t been created yet? Let’s create that canvas. In the `\u003cbody\u003e`, remove the line that imports `script.js` and replace it with\n\n```html\n\u003ccanvas id=\"splatterPaint\"\u003e\u003c/canvas\u003e\n```\n\nAmazing! we’ve got ourselves a canvas.\n\n## Drawing some circles\n\nNow that we’ve successfully imported Paper.js and created a canvas to work on, it’s time to write the JavaScript code that will create our splatter paint.\n\nLet’s write a function that draws a circle at the cursor’s position whenever the mouse is moved.\n\nNavigate to your `script.js` file and create a function called `onMouseMove`:\n\n```js\nfunction onMouseMove(event) {}\n```\n\nAlthough you can normally call functions whatever you want, it’s important that this function is called `onMouseMove` and passes in an `event`. Paper.js knows what `onMouseMove` is—when it sees this function, it will know to run the code you write inside it every time your mouse moves, and that the `event` you pass in is a [Paper.js Mouse Event](https://paperjs.org/reference/mouseevent/). Cool, right?\n\nTime to draw our circle! Inside the function you just created, add this code snippet, which creates a circle at the mouse cursor with a radius of 10px:\n\n```js\nvar path = new Path.Circle({\n  center: event.middlePoint,\n  radius: 10\n})\n```\n\nIf you run your repl now and move your mouse around, you’ll see...nothing. You are, in fact, drawing circles, but the circles are currently transparent. So, let’s give them some color. Under the previous code snippet, still in the `onMouseMove` function, add:\n\n```js\npath.fillColor = {\n  hue: 0,\n  saturation: 1,\n  brightness: 1\n}\n```\n\nRight now, your entire `script.js` file should look like this:\n\n```js\nfunction onMouseMove(event) {\n  var path = new Path.Circle({\n    center: event.middlePoint,\n    radius: 10\n  })\n  path.fillColor = {\n    hue: 0,\n    saturation: 1,\n    brightness: 1\n  }\n}\n```\n\nInstead of using the more common hexademical or RGB color systems, Paper.js uses the HSB color system, which uses angles on a color wheel to describe color. In the HSB color system, 0 = 0° = red, and `360*n`° is also red.\n\n![Color wheel in which each color is assigned a degree value](https://cloud-b0scmt0cu-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0hsb-color-wheel.png)\n\n(If you’re interested in learning more about the HSB color system, check out [this fantastic explanation](https://learnui.design/blog/the-hsb-color-system-practicioners-primer.html))\n\nWith this in mind, try running your repl now. Because you set `hue` to 0, you’re now drawing red circles! But your circles only appear in the top left corner of the screen. That’s because the width and height of your canvas are currently set to the Paper.js defaults (300px by 150px).\n\nLet’s make your canvas fill the whole screen. In your `style.css` file, add the following:\n\n```css\ncanvas {\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n}\n```\n\nRun your repl again.\n\nAlmost there. The CSS you just wrote set the canvas width and height to 100% of the parent element. In your `index.html` file, `\u003cbody\u003e` is parent element of the `\u003ccanvas\u003e` because you created the canvas in between the `\u003cbody\u003e` tags.\n\n`\u003cbody\u003e` is currently as big as its own parent element, `\u003chtml\u003e`, which doesn’t quite fill the whole screen. With this in mind, add the following to your CSS file:\n\n```css\nhtml,\nbody {\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n  margin: 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis sets the width and height of the body to the width and height of your screen, and removes any extra space between the edge of your screen and the body.\n\nJust to recap: your entire CSS file should now look like this:\n\n```css\nhtml,\nbody {\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n  margin: 0;\n}\ncanvas {\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n}\n```\n\nIf you run your repl again, you should notice that your red circles are now filling the entire screen!\n\n![Random pattern formed by red circles](https://cloud-3aosybiuc-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/6red-circles.jpg)\n\n## Making it Splattery\n\nWe’re getting somewhere, but this still doesn’t feel very splattery.\n\n![colorful paint randomly splattered on a canvas](https://cloud-3aosybiuc-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/5real-splatter-paint.jpg)\n\nPart of what makes splatter paint so fun to create and look at is the chaotic randomness of everything on the canvas. So, if you want to get your website as close to splatter paint as possible, the best way to do it is to introduce some randomness.\n\nChange the radius of your circles from `10` to `Math.round(Math.random() * 25) + 5`. This makes the radius a random number between 5 and 30. Then run the repl again.\n\n![Circles with large radii forming a random pattern on a canvas](https://cloud-3aosybiuc-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/4random-radius.jpg)\n\nNot bad, but it feels sort of mashed together, doesn’t it? Maybe we can make each circle unique by making it a different color than the last. Try changing the hue from `0` to `event.count * 3`. Run the repl and see what happens.\n\n![Rainbow assortment of circles of various sizes on a canvas](https://cloud-3aosybiuc-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/3rainbow-colors.jpg)\n\n`event.count * 3` creates a rainbow effect by setting the hue on each circle to the total number of times a circle has been drawn multiplied by 3, which jumps around the HSB color wheel. And it looks great!\n\nCongratulations! You can now splatter colorful circles all over your screen. If you haven’t already, open your repl in a new tab and treat yourself to a bigger canvas to go crazy on.\n\n## Hacking\n\nYour journey is far from over. There are endless directions you can take this project in. Here are a few suggestions.\n\n1. If you want to increase the distance between each circle, you can add `tool.fixedDistance = SOME_NUMBER` to the top of your `script.js` file. This will fire the event after your cursor has moved every `SOME_NUMBER` px instead of every time your mouse moves. You can set it to fixed number, or you can make it random!\n2. If you find the rainbows too predictable, you can set the hue to a random number between 0 and 360 (remember, this covers every color on the HSB system).\n3. Who says your canvas has to be white? Try setting the background color of your website to something custom—your favorite color, an image, or even a [gradient](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/linear-gradient)—and/or change it every time a new circle is created.\n4. Who says you have to draw circles? Try drawing a random mix of circles, ovals of random lengths and widths, and other shapes.\n5. Randomness is fun, but controlled randomness is even more fun. Take a look at the [Paper.js docs on mouse events](https://paperjs.org/reference/mouseevent/). How can you use the properties of the MouseEvent to play with the radius? (here’s what I came up with: try setting the radius to `event.delta.length` and see what happens)\n6. If you want to hurt your eyes and ears, try using the [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io) library to play a synth sound of a random frequency whenever a new circle is created.\n\nHere are some example projects that have stemmed from this project:\n\n- [https://welllitvelvetyoperation.techbug2012.repl.co](https://welllitvelvetyoperation.techbug2012.repl.co)\n- [https://splatter-paint-crazy.techbug2012.repl.co](https://splatter-paint-crazy.techbug2012.repl.co) (**WARNING: FLASHY COLORS**)\n- [https://wlhc-paperjs-demo-custom1.glitch.me](https://wlhc-paperjs-demo-custom1.glitch.me)\n\nNow, your task is to spend the rest of the meeting making this project insanely cool and totally unique!"

First, the base! The most important part, and the thing that \nholds everything up... *drum roll please...* the storyline!\n\n![The storyline, the base of all games, is like the dough of a pizza. ](https://cloud-kck0n0txs-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0copy_of_copy_of_arial.gif)\n\n## What Makes Text Based Adventure Games SO Playable?\n\nCYOA's are interactive experiences that transport players into imaginative worlds through text based narratives. They normally have rich \nstorylines which make players embark on thrilling quests, solve puzzles, and make choices that shape the course of the game!\n\nEmbracing the power of imagination, these games are extremely immersive and invite players to visualize the game world and become active \nparticipants in the unfolding story. \n\nMoral of the story is that text adventure games have a huge emphasis on storyline and user interaction. The adventures had are timeless \nand engaging gaming experiences for players of all ages. \n\nSo what's the most important part? Planning.\n\n\n## Game Design\n\n![You need to branch out with Gane Design](https://cloud-d4qej17bj-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0story2.gif)\n\n### Choosing a Theme or Setting! \n\n\nStart brainstorming different themes or settings for your story! It could be a mysterious haunted mansion, fantastical forest, or anything \nthat sparks your imagination! Here are some ideas to get started:\n\n- You discover a secret cave with mysterious tunnels each housing... peculiar creatures\n- You and a group of friends decide to go to a haunted mansion, but things aren't at all what they seem\n- You're being chased and have to escape a maze\n- You're opening your own pizza shop\n- You're stranded on a desert island\n- You're the mayor of a small and... quiet... town\n- Create a short \"what  ___ am I?\" quiz\n- Create a realistic roleplay \n- Each person is gifted a special power... what's yours?\n\nThe best part is the sky's the limit! Keep brainstorming until you find something you want to start with.\n\nAlso consider the potential story choices, depth, and player engagement.\n\n### Planning Game Structure!\n![Planning a player's journey](https://cloud-ojeynixq6-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0untitled_design-removebg-preview.png)\n\nDefine what the game structure by figuring out the overall goal that players will strive to achieve. It can be finding treasure, surviving \non an abandoned island, solving a mystery, or saving the world!\n\nIn this stage determine the key challenges, events, or puzzles the players will face through their journey. You can also take this time to \ndivide your game into different chapters/levels if you would like. \n\nNow figure out your player's choices. Imagine a tree, and each choice is a different branch of the story. Identify these \"branching off\" \npoints in the narrative where the player's choices will affect the outcome. \n\n### Characters!\n![Characters](https://cloud-8yiaur9jb-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0untitled_design__2_.gif)\n\nThis is also a good time to figure out any potential non-player characters (NPC's). These are characters that the player can interact with \nand can make the storyline richer.  \n\nHere are some tips that can help your character become more fleshed out, relatable, and believable, hooking the user to your game:\n\n- Make your characters have \"strong\" and or detailed backstories that can include their past experiences, goals, motivations, etc.\n- Give your characters unique personalities! Think about their temperament, speech patterns, and quirks. How do they express themselves\n  and relate to others? \n\t- When writing their dialogue pay attention to how they speak and their language; make sure it reflects their personality and\n          background.\n- These NPCs can even have a character arc throughout the story, or perhaps the user's character can influence them. \n\t- You could even create side quests that allow the user to strengthen their relationship with them allowing the, to unlock other\n          levels. \n\t\t- This can allow your player to have a more immersive experience.\n- You can also make your characters complex by considering their relationships with other NPC characters in the game or the user's. \n\nOnce you're all done writing everything up- let's start programming!\n\n\n## Setting Up Replit\n![Replit.com Home Page](https://cloud-rmnz8besq-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0replit_sigh_up.gif) \n\nBefore continuing further, make sure to set up or log in to your https://replit.com account. \n\n![Create a New Repl](https://cloud-lthzt6trl-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0untitled_design.gif)\n\nOnce there click on 'Create a New Repl'\n\nPick 'Python' as your programming language. \n\nAnd name the file what you would like ex. CYOA_Part_1\n\n\n### Main Game loop\n\nTo start we have to have something that will loop for the game checking if the player wants to quit or start over.  To do this we will be \nusing a `while` loop. \n\nNow what is that? Why is it important?\n\nWell we want something to loop/run through the code for an *unlimited* amount of time that checks whether or not our game will end. \n\nThat is *exactly* what a `while` loop is! It is a repetitive loop that runs until a certain condition becomes *false*! \n\nLet's start by creating our game's status. We would like the game to keep running until the game's status goes from \"yes\" to \"no\". Here's \nan example: `gameStart == \"yes\"`. \n\nThen we need to set our loop to continuously check that our game's status is equal to \"yes\". For this, we will write `while` followed by \nour condition (`gameStart == yes`) and a colon. \n\nThen we have to make sure that our player can add their input to determine whether they want to play or not. Inside the while loop, we \nwill add our variable again: `gameStart` but we'll set it `=` to `input(\"\")` and inside the `\"\"` we can add the question of whether or not \nthey would like to quit.\n\n*Note: keep in mind that if they would like to restart or continue with the game it has to equal what our variable was, in this case, \n\"yes\" if they input anything else the game will quit.*\n\nYay! We've successfully created a `while` loop that checks whether or not our game has ended based on the player's input.\n\nThis is what an example of the should look like:\n\n```py\ngameStart = \"yes\"\n\nwhile gameStart == \"yes\":\n    gameStart = input(\"Would you like to restart? \")\n\n```\n\n\n## Let's Make Our Game Design Come to Life!\n\n### Input System \n\nLet's say for this game we are crafting a pizza and have different choices for special edition toppings: Potatoes or Champignon Mushrooms \nusing the `print` function.\n\n```py\ngameStart = \"yes\"\n\nwhile gameStart == \"yes\":\n\n    # this is a comment, something that will not appear in the \n      final game\n    # It is great for taking notes and explaining code!\n    # add all game-related content inside this loop\n\n    print(\"Welcome to La Mia Pizzeria Preferita!\")\n    print(\"What would you like for your toppings? Potatoes or \n    Champignon Mushrooms\")\n\n    gameStart = input(\"Would you like to restart? \")\n\n```\n\nLike earlier we would like our player to be able to *choose* what they would like to do. To do that let's create a variable to store our \nuser's input for this particular question and name it `pizza_choice`.  Like earlier, we're going to set `pizza_choice` = to `input(\"\")`. \n\n`input(\" *insert text/question here* \")` prompts our player to respond, allows the program to wait for user input, and stores that in the \nvariable it is = to for further processing later on (ex. what happens when they choose different options). \n\nit will look something like this: `pizza_choice = input(\"Please choose one \u003e \")`\n\n### Choices (Conditionals)\n\nBut how will we use the input?\n\nSimple! Conditionals! These are composed of `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements which enable your program to perform different actions or \nexecute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false! \n\n*unlike `while` loops* they do *not* run forever. \n\nUsing our example from before: `if pizza_choice`  is `==` to `\"Potatoes\"` then `:` let's `print(\"\")` \"You chose\" `+ pizza_choice +` \"!  \nThat's delicious! Coming right up!\"\n\nBut our other if/else if or in python, `elif pizza_choice` is `==` to `\"Champignon Mushrooms\"` then `:` let's `print(\"\")` \"You chose\" `+ \npizza_choice +` \"! It is a fan favorite!\"\n\nBut what if our user inputs something different? If we don't plan for that, then our program will have an `error` and the game will stop. \nSo, if our player writes anything `else` or other than our option, then `:` we'll `print(\"\")` out \"Sorry we do not have that item. Come \nback another time.\"\n\nThe final code would look something like this: \n```py\ngameStart = \"yes\"\n\nwhile gameStart == \"yes\":\n\n    # this is a comment, something that will not appear in the final game\n    # It is great for taking notes and explaining code!\n    # add all game related content inside this loop\n\n    print(\"Welcome to La Mia Pizzeria Preferita!\")\n    print(\"What would you like for your toppings? Potatoes or \n    Champignon Mushrooms\")\n\n    pizza_choice = input(\"Please choose one \u003e \")\n\n    if pizza_choice == \"Potatoes\":\n        print(\"You chose\" + pizza_choice + \"! That's delicious!\n        Coming right up!\")\n\n    elif pizza_choice == \"Champignon Mushrooms\":\n\t        print(\"You chose\" + pizza_choice + \"! It is a fan   \n\t        favorite!\")\n\n    else:\n        print(\"Sorry we do not have that item. Come back another \n        time.\")\n\n    gameStart = input(\"Would you like to restart? \")\n\n```\n\n### Point Systems\n\nIf you are also interested in making a point system for your game start by making a variable, let's call it `points` and set it ` = 0` (or \nwhatever number of points you want your character to start with).\n\nNext, we need to define (`def`) our function that adds the points the player gets throughout the game let's call it \n`add_points(number_of_points)`. Then `:` we're going to make our `points` variable `global` meaning that it can be easily accessed and \nchanged anywhere throughout the code. \n\nUnder that, we need to say that our `points` will get combined `+=` with the `number_of_points` the player earns. \n\nTo tell our player how many points they got let's create another `def` for our function `print_points()` then `:` say `print(\"You have {} \npoints.\")` and let's insert the number of points our player got by adding `.format(points)` which will change our placeholder `{}` with \nthe number of points our player has.\n\nHere is what we should get:\n```py\npoints = 0\n\ndef add_points(number_of_points):\n  global points\n  points += number_of_points\n\ndef print_points():\n  print(\"You have {} adventure points.\".format(points))\n```\n\nTo add points we should call the `add_points()` function and determine in the `()` how many points to add.\n\nTo `print` how many points the player has just use the `print_points()` function. \n\n```py\nadd_points(30)\nprint_points()\n```\n\nWith this base, you can now use a combination of while loops, conditionals, print, and input functions to build fabulous tales!\n\n\n## Congratulations!\n\nYou have successfully finished ***Level 1: The Storyteller's Forge***! You now have your own Adventure Game which you can publish, share \nwith family and friends, and play! \n\n#### Want to take your build to the next level? \n\nLet's add some music and customization options (like colors and text animation!)\nGo to the next level now! \n\n\n##  Level 2: Sonic Sagas\n### Adding Music and Style to your Text-Based Adventure Game\n\n![Adding music and style](https://cloud-3usasijgs-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0copy_of_arial.gif)\n\nOnce again, great job in finishing ***Level 1: The Storyteller's Forge***. Now we're moving on to the second layer of the **pizza**, the \n*sauce*! A cool add-on that gives a kick of flavor! In this level, we will be learning how to add background music, sound effects, text \nanimation, and color! \n\n\u003cvideo src=\"https://cloud-mxm9fsiqn-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0level_2_cyoa.mp4\" controls=\"controls\" style={{width: \"100%\"}}\u003e\u003c/video\u003e\n\nHere is the example code of what we're going to create!: https://replit.com/@ConnemaraPony/Intermediate-CYOA?v=1\n\n\n## Making Music\n\nBefore we learn how to incorporate music it is important to know where to *find* it. Nowadays, we have access to a variety of free music \nlibraries. Here are some examples:\n- YouTube Audio Library (Free)\n- Slip.Stream (Pro and Free)\n- Free Music Archive (Pro and Free)\n- SoundStripe (Pro and Free)\n- iMovie (Free)\n\nAlways remember that when publishing your work make sure the music or even graphics you use are *not* copyrighted because that can give \nyou a headache in the legal department. Instead, try to find *royalty free* music or have a license to use it commercially. \n\nYou can even make your own music! Here are some example options:\n- Create a music generator!\n- Use existing music software on your device (ex. GarageBand)\n- Make music on MuseScore\n\nOnce you figure out your music and sound effects... it's time to start!\n\n### Adding backGround() Music\n\nAdding music to your replit game is very simple! \nLet's start off by `import`ing the module `audio from` a package called `replit`. And add it at the very top of our game (I'll be using \nthe pizza example from earlier):\n```py\nfrom replit import audio\n\n# Rest of the game code goes below\nGameStart = \"yes\"\n\nwhile GameStart == \"yes\":\n\t...\n```\n\nNow you have to make sure to import your music files to the project. You can either drag and drop your files into the sidebar or press \n\"new file.\"\n\nOnce everything is downloaded let's define the music we're adding to our game. The function I'm going to `def` is the `backGround()` \nfunction and then `:` I'm going to show where the program can locate my music file or `source`. I'll set `source =` to my \n`audio.play_file('')` so that it knows to process and play my music, and inside the `''` I'll add my file name. In this case \n`'Mezzogiorno.mp3'`. \n\n*Note: Replit audio currently supports .wav, .mp3, and .aif files. If your file has a different extension then it will not work. *\n\nNow I need to make sure my music *plays* when the game is running. To do that I'll just call the function in the main loop like so: \n`backGround()`\n\nThere you have it! Here is what the code should look like:\n```py\n\"\"\"\nThis is a block comment which is great for comments that are longer than one line.\n\nMusic creators! \nBackground Music: Track: \"Mezzogiorno\"\nMusic provided by https://slip.stream\nFree Download / Stream: https://get.slip.stream/p2t2Ot\n\n\"\"\"\nfrom replit import audio\n\ndef backGround():\n    source = audio.play_file('Mezzogiorno.mp3')\n  \ngameStart = \"yes\"\nwhile gameStart == \"yes\":\n  # this is a comment, something that will not appear in the final \n    game\n  # It is great for taking notes and explaining code!\n  # add all game related content inside this loop   \n  \n  backGround()\n  \n  ...\n```\n\n### Adding soundEffects() \n\nYou use the *exact* same process for sound effects. But how can we determine the *duration* of it? To do that we will need to `import \ntime` package. Then, we'll go to our `def` function, and under the `source = ...` we'll add `time.sleep()`. This tells the computer how \nlong the music should play until it quits/sleeps. Inside the `()` add the duration. I'll make it set to `(2)`. Then, call on the function \nwherever you would like.\n\nHere is our updated code with my `pop()` sound effect function:\n```py\nfrom replit import audio\nimport time\n\ndef backGround():\n    source = audio.play_file('Mezzogiorno.mp3')\n\ndef pop():\n    source = audio.play_file('Pop.mp3')\n    time.sleep(2)\n  \ngameStart = \"yes\"\nwhile gameStart == \"yes\":\n  # add all game related content inside this loop   \n  \n  backGround()\n\n  pop()\n  print(\"Welcome to La Mia Pizzeria Preferita!\")\n\n...\n  \n```\n\n## Text Animation\n\nOne of the most popular text animations for CYOA games is the typewriter effect. So, let's make it! To start off let's `def` a function \ncalled `typewriter()` and inside the parentheses let's determine what this function will affect which is `(text)`. Then `:` we want to say \nthat `for` each letter `in` our `text` the program should then `:` `print()` our `letter`s side by side which can be written as `end=\"\"`, \nand it should be immediately printed or `flush`ed out  which means we have to `=True`. Similar to how we determined music length we need \nto determine how long each letter should wait until it's printed out, to do that we'll use `time.sleep()` and in the parentheses, I'll set \nit to `(0.05)`.\n\nWe should have something like this:\n```py\ndef typewriter(text):\n  for letter in text:\n    print(letter, end=\"\", flush=True)\n    time.sleep(0.05)\n```\n\nNow to call on it we can change any of the `print(\"\")` functions we have to `typewriter(\"\")`. Here is what our updated code should look \nlike:\n\n```py\nfrom replit import audio\nimport time\n\ndef typewriter(text):\n    for letter in text:\n       print(letter, end=\"\", flush=True)\n       time.sleep(0.05)\n    \ndef backGround():\n    source = audio.play_file('Mezzogiorno.mp3')\n\ndef pop():\n    source = audio.play_file('Pop.mp3')\n    time.sleep(2)\n  \ngameStart = \"yes\"\nwhile gameStart == \"yes\":\n  # add all game related content inside this loop   \n  \n  backGround()\n\n  pop()\n  typewriter(\"Welcome to La Mia Pizzeria Preferita!\")\n\n...\n```\n\n## Coloring Text\n\nAnother cool thing we can do is change our text's color! \n\nFor this, we need to head over to the tools sidebar and go to shell. In the shell let's type `pip install termcolor`. This is a package \nthat will help us change the color of our text. It might take a couple of seconds to load. \n\nAfter, let's head back to our `main.py` file and `import termcolor`. Let's `def` a new function and name it `change_color()` in the \nparentheses we want to make sure it takes in two inputs: `(text, color)`. The purpose of this function is to take the `text` and change it \nto a given `color`. To make this possible we then `:` write `termcolor.cprint(text,color)`. \n\nWe should have something like this:\n```py\nimport termcolor\n\ndef change_color(text, color):\n    termcolor.cprint(text, color)\n  \n```\n\nNow to call on it we can change any of the `print(\"\")` functions we have to `change_color((\"add whatever text we like here\"), (\"add \nwhatever color we like here\"))`. Here is what our updated code should look like:\n```py\nfrom replit import audio\nimport time\n\ndef typewriter(text):\n    for letter in text:\n        print(letter, end=\"\", flush=True)\n        time.sleep(0.05)\n    \ndef backGround():\n    source = audio.play_file('Mezzogiorno.mp3')\n\ndef pop():\n    source = audio.play_file('Pop.mp3')\n    time.sleep(2)\n  \ngameStart = \"yes\"\nwhile gameStart == \"yes\":\n  # add all game related content inside this loop   \n  \n  backGround()\n\n  pop()\n  typewriter(\"Welcome to La Mia Pizzeria Preferita!\", \"red\")\n```\n\n## Congratulations!\n\nYou have successfully finished ***Level 2: Sonic Sagas***! You now have your own Adventure Game with music and style which you can \npublish, share with family and friends, and play! \n\n#### Want to take your build to the next level? \n\nLet's add a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that will allow our player to interact with the game in a different way~ BUTTONS! \nGo to the next level now! \n\n\n## Level 3: GUI,  the Final Boss\n\n### Creating a Graphical User Interface \n\n![Putting everything together](https://cloud-8dmeqbifb-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0arial.gif)\n\nOnce again, great job in finishing **_Level 2: Sonic Sagas_**. Now we're moving on to the third and **final** layer of the **pizza**, \nthe *cheese*! It's the thing that all of our users will get to see and experience first before the storyline, music, etc. ***THE GUI!*** \n\n\u003cvideo src=\"https://cloud-o4r2cm0xj-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0point_systems_were_created_at_the_end_of_the_level_1_jam_.mp4\" controls=\"controls\" style={{width: \"100%\"}}\u003e\u003c/video\u003e\n\nHere is the example code of what we're going to create!: https://replit.com/@ConnemaraPony/Advanced-CYOA?v=1\n\n## Importing Libraries\n\nTo begin we need to import these packages in our Repl:\n```py\nimport tkinter as tk\nimport time\nfrom replit import audio\n```\n- `tkinter` is for creating the graphical user interface (GUI)\n- `time` is for delays in the typewriter effect and or specifying music duration\n- `audio` is for being able to read and play music \n\n## Point System\n\nLike how we implemented in Level 1 :\n```py\npoints = 0\n\ndef add_points(number_of_points):\n    global points\n    points += number_of_points\n\ndef print_points():\n    points_label.config(text=\"You have {} adventure points.\".format(points))\n\n# Place where you want players to get points + see num of points\nadd_points(30)\nprint_points()\n```\n\n## Text Animation\n\nSimilar to what we implemented in Level 2 but with a few minor changes: \n```py\n\ndef typewriter(text, text_widget):\n    for letter in text:\n        text_widget.config(state=tk.NORMAL)\n        if letter == \"\\n\":\n            text_widget.insert(tk.END, \"\\n\")\n        else:\n            text_widget.insert(tk.END, letter)\n            text_widget.see(tk.END)\n        text_widget.config(state=tk.DISABLED)\n        text_widget.update()\n        time.sleep(0.05)\n\n```\n\n- The function takes in two inputs instead of one `(text, text_widget)`\n- It still loops over each `letter in text` string\n- It makes our `text_widget` editable by setting its state to `tk.NORMAL` -- but what is that? \n\t- `text_widget`s are GUI elements that allow for text to appear on windows/frames instead of the terminal/console! (like what\n           you're seeing here!)\n-  If the letter is on a new line `(\"\\n\")` it adds a new line letter into the `text_widget` using the `insert` method. If a character is\n   *not* on a new line it inserts the letter in the widget using `insert`. Lastly, it positions the scrollbar to the end of the widget\n   using ` see(tk.END)` to make each letter visible.\n- After each character is added, the widget is set to `tk.DISABLED` to make it read-only (not editable by the user)\n- The widget is updated to show the changes made with `update` method\n- We still have the `time.sleep` function for a 0.05-second delay\n\n## Defining Game Functions\n\nThis is by far one of ***the most*** important parts. If we don't define our functions properly, or if the computer can not reference them \nduring the game then we'll be dealing with **A LOT** of errors. \n\nHere are some example functions we've already created:\n\n`add_points(number_of_points)` which keeps track of the player's points throughout the game. \n\n`print_points()` which prints out the number of points the player has.\n\n`typewriter(text, text_widget)` for simulating the typewriter effect. \n\nHere are some new ones: \n\nlet's `def` a function called `start_game` which is called when our Start button is pressed. It then `:` hides or `pack_forget` the \n`welcome_frame` and shows our new frame (in this case where the user inputs their name) `name_frame.pack()`. \n\n```py\ndef start_game():\n    welcome_frame.pack_forget()\n    name_frame.pack()\n```\n\nNext let's `def` our `submit_name` that we talked about earlier (while this is for a user's name, you can rename the function for another \nquestion where the user input is unique)\n```py\ndef submit_name():\n    global points\n\n\t# retrieving user input to store in widget name_entry\n    name = name_entry.get()\n    \n    # giving points\n    add_points(10)\n    print_points()\n    \n    # what the user sees\n    typewriter(f\"Hey {name}, now it's time to choose a morning \n    activity!\", output_text)\n    \n    # move on to the next frame and get current \n    name_frame.pack_forget()\n    activity_frame.pack()\n    \n```\n\nAlso, make sure to add each part of your story under a `def` function. For example, from above if our player had to choose a morning \nactivity we will `def` a function called `select_activity()`  where the player picks an `(activity)` button. Then `:` we can add our \nconditional statements and make sure to add `.pack_forget()` that closes a frame and `.pack` that opens a new frame where needed. \n\n```py\ndef select_activity(activity):\n\t\n    if activity == \"swimming\":\n        typewriter(\"You have chosen swimming!\", output_text)\n        \n        add_points(10)\n        print_points()\n        \n        typewriter(\"\\nYou go to the beach but boating is the only \n        thing available. You get a boat. Things are\n        going smoothly until your motor gives out.\", \n        output_text)\n        \n        typewriter(\"\\nYou have two options: SOS (try to flag down a \n        boat for help) or fix (fix the motor \n        yourself).\\n\", output_text)\n        \n        activity_frame.pack_forget()\n        helpSwim_frame.pack()\n        \n    elif activity == \"hiking\":\n        add_points(5)\n        print_points()\n        \n        typewriter(\"\\nThere are no trail leaders available at this \n        time. Try again later!\", output_text)\n        \n    elif activity == \"volunteer\":\n        add_points(5)\n        print_points()\n        \n        typewriter(\"\\nUnfortunately, they are still setting up \n        different volunteer opportunities. You decide to \n        rest in the shade and read a book.\", output_text)\n        \n    else:\n        \n        typewriter(\"\\nUnfortunately, this activity is closed for \n        the day for repairs.\", output_text)\n        \n        add_points(5)\n        print_points()\n        \n        typewriter(\"Choose a different activity\", output_text)\n```\n\nThen for the choices that branch out from the original should be `def`ined in a new function. By doing that, and adding a \n`helpSwim_frame.pack()` above, now I can extend my `swimming` adventure:\n```py\ndef submit_helpSwim():\n    global points\n    helpSwim = helpSwim_entry.get()\n    \n    if helpSwim == \"SOS\":\n        add_points(30)\n        print_points()\n        typewriter(\"You start waving your hands \n                   and yelling at the \n                   top of your lungs.\", \n                   output_text)\n        typewriter(\"\\nEach second that passes, \n                   the boat is pulled \n                   further away from shore.

It gets \nthe user's choice from the `helpSwim_entry` field and gives a different scenario based on the choice (what happens in the conditional \nstatements).\n\nKeep storing each part of your in `def` functions... after you're done, let's get to the fun part!\n\n## Creating Main Window and Frames!\n\nWe've been talking a lot about windows and frames-- but what are they and what's the difference? Lastly, *how* do we *MAKE* them?\n\n![Comparing windows and frames](https://cloud-p55izwnla-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0digital.png)\n\nThis might sound crazy but imagine a house. The window is like an entire house. It has its own structure, windows and doors (title bar, \nand controls), walls (size of window), etc. and it is the main thing that the user interacts with. \n\nLet's start by creating the `window` object and setting it `=` to the `Tk()` constructor from the `tk` module. This will create the main \nwindow of the application. \n```py\nwindow = tk.Tk()\n```\nNext, let's make the `title` bar by writing `window.title(\"\")` and in the `\"\"` writing our title. \n\nWhile we're at it, let's set the size of the window by writing `window.geometry(\"\")`, and in the `\"\"` we can specify the size. For now, \nlet's make it `(\"600x400\")` pixels.  \n\nThis is more of a style choice, but I do not want the window to keep resizing depending on the amount of content inside it. To do this \nlet's write `window.resizable()`. Inside the parentheses, it has two arguments width and height. Let's make sure that they *do not* get \nresized by making them both `False`.\n\nBy the end we should have something like this:\n```py\nwindow.title(\"Camp Wildwood Adventure\")\nwindow.geometry(\"600x400\")\nwindow.resizable(False, False)\n```\n\nNext are frames! Building off of our house concept, frames are like the rooms inside of a house. They have their own walls, supports, \netc., and are areas where you can arrange your \"furniture\" items and other decor like text, input, buttons, etc. \n\nEach new event that happens in our game will have a `Frame`. \nTo create a frame, first, make a variable for example `welcome_frame`, and set it `=` to `tk.Frame(window)`. \n\nContinue this for each scene change you have in the game. Here is what we have in our example:\n```py\nwelcome_frame = tk.Frame(window)\nname_frame = tk.Frame(window)\nactivity_frame = tk.Frame(window)\nhelpSwim_frame = tk.Frame(window)\n```\n\n## More GUI Components\n\nLet's Create our Buttons and input using our  `def` function `helpSwim` from earlier as an example. \n\nAll the GUI components we're going to create for each scenario will be connected to their respective frames. For `helpSwim` we have the \n`helpSwim_frame` from the previous step. \n\n### Crafting Labels!\n\nFirst step is to create a `label` that `=` its respective `frame`, displaying specified `text` like the question we want to ask the user \nto answer. Then we want to make sure our `label` is organized and displayed within our frame using the `.pack` method:\n\n```py\nhelpSwim_label = tk.Label(helpSwim_frame,  \n                        text=\"SOS (try to flag\n                        down a boat for help) or \n                        fix (fix the motor \n                        yourself)?\" \n    \nhelpSwim_label.pack() \n```\n\n### User Text-Input!\n\nSecond step let's make this answer have a text input, to do that let's create a text `Entry()` widget, connect it to our `frame`, and make \nsure it displays by using the `.pack` method:\n\n```py\nhelpSwim_entry = tk.Entry(helpSwim_frame) helpSwim_entry.pack() \n```\n\n### Buttons!\n\nNext, let's create a submit button (this button format will also work if you're asking your user to choose a button rather than add text \ninput like above). \n\nFirst, let's create a button widget using the `Button()` class from the `tk` library. The button widget is used to show different \nscenarios when clicked by the user. We also need to connect it to its set `frame`, and make sure we have `text` displayed on the button, \nthat `= \"Submit\"` in this case. \n\nWe also need our button to be called when it is clicked. To do that we need to use the `command` parameter and set it `=` to our `def` \nfunction, in this case `submit_helpSwim` which we defined earlier. \n\nLet's also make things fun and change the button color! To do this we use `bg` and set it `=` to a color name. Let's just use `\"purple\"` \nfor now. \n\nLike before, our *last step* is using `.pack()` to make sure it is displayed correctly~ we should have something like this:\n\n```py\nhelpSwim_button = tk.Button(helpSwim_frame, text=\"Submit\", command=submit_helpSwim, bg=\"purple\") \n\nhelpSwim_button.pack()\n```\n\n### Text Widgets!\n\nLet's also make sure that our storyline has a place to get displayed by creating a `Text` widget that can display multi-line text that is \nset to read-only (so that our users can not alter it). \n\nLet's create a variable called `output_text` which creates our text widget. Let's use the `Text()` parameter from the `tk` library. We \nneed to make sure it is placed in our `window` so that it always appears, and set our `height =` to what we want, and our `width =` to \nwhat we want. \n\nWe also want to make sure our text is pleasing to look at, and if a word exceeds the width it should go to a new line. To do that we'll \nuse the `wrap` parameter that does just that and set it `=` to `tk.WORD` so that it doesn't break apart words and ensures that whole words \nare shown on a single line. \n\nIt should look something like this:\n\n```py\noutput_text = tk.Text(window, height=10,  \n\t\t\t         width=50, wrap=tk.WORD) \n```\n\nAs said before we want to make sure our text is on *read-only*. To do that we will configure or `config()` the state of the `output_text` \nwidget and set it `=` to `tk.DISABLED` which doesn't allow the user to edit it. \n\nLastly we *need* to `.pack` it to make sure it displays properly:\n\n```py\noutput_text.config(state=tk.DISABLED) \noutput_text.pack()\n```\n\nRepeat the first three for all scenarios in your game! Feel free to play around with different questions having user input be either \nbuttons or text and even multiple text widgets!\n\n## Displaying Frames and Starting Loop\n\nFinally, it's time for our open house! We can now display the welcome frame and start the GUI event loop using `mainloop()`:\n```py \nwelcome_frame.pack()\nwindow.mainloop()\n```\n\n\n## Congratulations!\n\nYou have successfully finished **_Level 3: GUI the Final Boss_**!

The `DataCard` represents each object within the tier-list.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/PtVn0NT/image.png)\nFirst, navigate to **components/DataCard.tsx**.\nWe want to import `Draggable` from `@hello-pangea/dnd` and then define the arguments our component will take.\n```tsx\nimport { Draggable } from '@hello-pangea/dnd'\n\ninterface DataCardProps {\n    id: string // this is a unique identifier -- so we know what's getting dragged!\n    index: number // this is the item's position within the tier\n    imageUrl: string // this is the image!\n}\n```\n\nAfter this, we can define our component.\n```tsx\nimport { Draggable } from '@hello-pangea/dnd'\n\ninterface DataCardProps {\n    id: string // this is a unique identifier -- so we know what's getting dragged!\n    index: number // this is the item's position within the tier\n    imageUrl: string // this is the image!\n}\n\nexport default function DataCard({ id, index, imageUrl }: DataCardProps) {\n    //\n}\n```\n\nWithin this, we can return our draggable `DataCard`. To create a draggable, you need to use the `Draggable` component from `@hello-pangea/dnd`. The child element will be a function which gives the needed references and props to be able to have a draggable. That function will return the Draggable's content. \n```tsx\nimport { Draggable } from '@hello-pangea/dnd';\n\ninterface DataCardProps {\n    id: string;\n    index: number;\n    imageUrl: string;\n}\n\nexport default function DataCard({ id, index, imageUrl }: DataCardProps) {\n    return (\n        \u003cDraggable draggableId={id} index={index}\u003e\n            {(provided) =\u003e (\n                \u003cdiv\n                    ref={provided.innerRef}\n                    {...provided.draggableProps}\n                    {...provided.dragHandleProps}\n                \u003e\n                    \u003cimg className=\"w-16\" src={imageUrl} /\u003e\n                \u003c/div\u003e\n            )}\n        \u003c/Draggable\u003e\n    );\n}\n```\n\n# Part 2: Create a Droppable\nEach tier has a droppable area where items can be moved around!\n![](https://i.ibb.co/dbMNn4D/image.png)\n\nIn this section, we are creating a droppable container! Within that container, we are also showing the tier's items.\nFirst, navigate to **components/Tier.tsx**.\n\nLet's define the props as well as component. We will also show the name of the tier.\n```tsx\nimport { Droppable } from '@hello-pangea/dnd';\nimport DataCard from './DataCard';\n\ninterface TierProps {\n    name: string\n    data: { id: string, imageUrl: string }[]\n    className?: string\n}\n\nexport default function Tier({ name, data, className = '' }: TierProps) {\n    return (\n        \u003cdiv className=\"flex\"\u003e\n            \u003cdiv className={'w-32 py-8 text-center ' + className}\u003e{ name }\u003c/div\u003e\n\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n    )\n}\n```\n\nAfter this, we can start creating our droppable. Also, we will put our data into their respective tiers.\n\n```tsx\nimport { Droppable } from '@hello-pangea/dnd';\nimport DataCard from './DataCard';\n\ninterface TierProps {\n    name: string\n    data: { id: string, imageUrl: string }[]\n    className?: string\n}\n\nexport default function Tier({ name, data, className = '' }: TierProps) {\n    return (\n        \u003cdiv className=\"flex\"\u003e\n            \u003cdiv className={'w-32 py-8 text-center ' + className}\u003e{ name }\u003c/div\u003e\n\n            \u003cDroppable droppableId={name} direction=\"horizontal\"\u003e\n                {(provided) =\u003e (\n                    \u003cdiv\n                        className=\"pl-4 flex flex-wrap items-center gap-4 border w-full select-none\"\n                        ref={provided.innerRef}\n                        {...provided.droppableProps}\n                    \u003e\n                        {data.map((data, index) =\u003e (\n                            \u003cDataCard\n                                key={data.id}\n                                id={data.id}\n                                index={index}\n                                imageUrl={data.imageUrl}\n                            /\u003e\n                        ))}\n                        {provided.placeholder}\n                    \u003c/div\u003e\n                )}\n            \u003c/Droppable\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n    )\n}\n```\n\nDroppable, similar to draggable, also requires a child function that returns the content. In this case, it would be the various DataCards from each element of `data`. In the 4th section, we'll go over how to customize this data.\n\n# Part 3: Create the Tier List\nLet's put all the previous parts together. In this part, simply map the different tiers from the `tiers` variable into `Tier` components.\n\n**App.tsx**\n```tsx\nimport { DragDropContext, DropResult } from '@hello-pangea/dnd';\nimport Tier from './components/Tier';\nimport { useTierState } from './useTierState';\nimport { arrayMove, arrayTransfer } from './helpers';\n\nexport default function App() {\n    const [tiers, setTiers] = useTierState();\n\n    function onDragEnd(result: DropResult) {\n        // We will implement this together in the 5th part!\n    }\n\n    return (\n        \u003cDragDropContext onDragEnd={onDragEnd}\u003e\n            \u003cdiv\u003e\n                {tiers.map((tier) =\u003e (\n                    \u003cTier\n                        key={tier.name}\n                        className={tier.className}\n                        name={tier.name}\n                        data={tier.data}\n                    /\u003e\n                ))}\n            \u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003c/DragDropContext\u003e\n    );\n}\n```\n\n# Part 4: Customize Tier List!\nIf you run the site, you'll notice that there are already items in the tier list. However, we can customize this to whatever you want!\n\nIn the `useTierState.ts` file, you'll notice how each tier is defined. Each tier has a name, data, and a className.\n\nHere's what you need to know:\n- the tier name must be unique\n- the className will only be applied to the box with the tier name\n- for each item, the id must be unique\n\nTo customize your tier list, simply change the data within the unranked tier. **Tip**: You can drag and drop images into your project's `public` directory, or you can provide a direct link to the image.\n\nHere's an example:\n```\n[\n    {\n        id: '1', imageUrl: 'https://i.ibb.co/DRd2Fg4/image.png',\n    },\n    {\n        id: '2', imageUrl: 'my_image.png'\n    }\n]\n```\n\n# Part 5: Implementing onDragEnd\nFirst, this function takes one argument, which is of type `DropResult`. This contains all the \"context\" of the event. For example, the draggable being dragged or the droppable which it's getting dragged to.\n\nThere are a couple cases we want to handle.\n1. If the item (draggable) is not being moved to a tier (droppable).\n2. If the item is being moved within the tier.\n3. If the item is being moved between tiers.\n\nLet's set that up:\n```ts\nfunction onDragEnd(result: DropResult) {\n    if (!result.destination) return // we can't do anything if the item isn't being dragged into/within a tier\n\n    const oldIndex = result.source.index // this is the original position of the item\n    const newIndex = result.destination.index // this is the new position of the item\n    const oldTierName = result.source.droppableId // this is the original tier of the item\n    const newTierName = result.destination.droppableId // this is the new tier of the item\n\n    if (oldTierName === newTierName) {\n        // this means the item is being moved within the current tier\n    } else {\n        // this means the item is being moved to another tier\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow, if the item is moved within the tier, we simply have to move the item within that tier's array of data. If the item is moved to another tier, we remove it from the old tier and add it to the new tier.\n\nHere's how that looks like:\n```ts\nfunction onDragEnd(result: DropResult) {\n    if (!result.destination) return;\n\n    const oldIndex = result.source.index;\n    const newIndex = result.destination.index;\n    const oldTierName = result.source.droppableId;\n    const newTierName = result.destination.droppableId;\n    \n    if (oldTierName === newTierName)\n        setTiers((prevTiers) =\u003e {\n            const tier = prevTiers.find(\n                (tier) =\u003e tier.name === oldTierName\n            )!;\n            \n            arrayMove(tier.data, oldIndex, newIndex); // I've implemented this helper function for you!\n            \n            return prevTiers;\n        });\n    else\n        setTiers((prevTiers) =\u003e {\n            const oldTier = prevTiers.find(\n                (tier) =\u003e tier.name === oldTierName\n            )!;\n            const newTier = prevTiers.find(\n                (tier) =\u003e tier.name === newTierName\n            )!;\n            \n            arrayTransfer(oldTier.data, newTier.data, oldIndex, newIndex); // I've implemented this helper function for you!\n            \n            return prevTiers\n        });\n}\n```\n\n# Final Code Example\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-dpvrzw?file=README.md\n"

But we can move over to the next session.\nThe code snippets are already implemented so no need to worry about that!\nThis section is purely informative.\n\nNow let's get to the **meat of this jam!**\n\n## THREE.JS Basics\n\nThis section will cover the basics of three.js, so you can start with the rendering.\n\n### Importing it\n\nYes, it's time! This is where we import THREE.JS for rendering. :D\nIf you had previous experience with Javascript you may already know how to import things but for those who don't, here is an explanatory Image.\n![image](https://cloud-oe00kf8q6-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\nFor those who have figured it out by the image congrats!\nImports are just requests to another javascript file saying that we want to load something from them.\n\nNow let's add them!\nYour javascript lives on the `script.js` file. So all we got to do is add **1 import statements**, well actually 3 because we also got to import the 3D model loader and the orbit controller.\n\nLet's add these 3 lines to the start of the `script.js`.\n\n```js\nimport * as THREE from \"three\"; // Imports everything from THREE.JS\nimport { OrbitControls } from \"three/addons/controls/OrbitControls.js\"; // Imports the orbit controller\nimport { OBJLoader } from \"three/addons/loaders/OBJLoader.js\"; // Imports the 3D model loader\n```\n\n### Creating a simple THREE.JS renderer\n\nWell it is time! We will add one of **the most crucial piece of 3D rendering.**\nThe **RENDERER!** It will handle, well, the rendering :D\n\nThree.js makes this process a **lot less** tedious that it would normally be so let's jump into it.\nIn the `script.js` paste the following lines:\n\n```js\nconst renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();\nrenderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);\ndocument.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);\n```\n\nIn the first line we initialize the THREE WebGL renderer, it will handle the rendering job.\nIn the second line we set the rendering size, and we pass the window width and height.\nIn the third line we append the renderer, so we can actually see.\n\u003cimg src=\"https://cloud-lnspzc1vi-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1meme_magic.jpg\" width=\"40%\"/\u003e\n\n### The coordinate system\n\nWell let's make a quick reference to the **three.js coordinate system**.\nLike mostly all 3D applications, three.js utilizes the **Cartesian _coordinate system_**.\nHere is a quick illustration of it:\n![cartesian_system_illustration](https://cloud-brf44h742-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\nAs shown above the height uses the **_Y_** variable, the depth uses the **_Z_**, and the width uses the **_X_** variable.\nWell that is all you need to know about it! Let's render some cubes! :D\n\n## Adding a camera, sample cubes and cube animation!\n\nNow, it's finally time to do the main part! :)\n\n### Adding a camera\n\nWe first need to add a camera, so we can render the scene!\nTo create the camera we will also need a scene first, so let's add that!\n\nCopy this line above the render code, in order to initialize a new scene\n\n```js\nconst scene = new THREE.Scene(); // Init Scene\n```\n\nThen we need to create and add the camera!\n\n```js\nconst camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(\n    50,\n    window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight,\n    0.1,\n    1000\n); // Init Camera\n\n// Change camera position\ncamera.position.z = 16;\ncamera.position.y = 16 / 4;\n```\n\nA perspective camera has 4 parameters, here they are ordered start to finish:\n\n-   FOV: Camera frustum vertical field of view.\n-   ASPECT: Camera frustum aspect ratio.\n-   NEAR: Camera frustum near plane.\n-   FAR: Camera frustum far plane.\n    For now use these defaults, if you want to learn more, [click here](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/cameras/PerspectiveCamera)\n\n### Now let's add a cube\n\nThat would be really easy actually!\nSo what are you waiting for?\n\nBelow the renderer add these lines:\n\n```js\n// Materials\nconst cubeMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000 }); // We need to add a material, each material takes the arguement inside an object called color. It is in HEX.\n\n// Add the objects\nconst cube = new THREE.Mesh(new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1), cubeMaterial); // We create a new cube, by default it DOES not exist in the scene\n```\n\n#### BoxGeometry\nOkay I did that, but what is THREE.BoxGeometry, you might say?  \nBox geometry is the size of the cube, each parameter is another dimension.\ni.e. This cube is 1x1x1  \n\n#### Material\nOkay okay, we got that figured out but what exactly does the `MeshBasicMaterial` do?  \nThe `MeshBasicMaterial` is the **material** that the object will have.  \nThe material will define its **texture and color**, so it is pretty important to know how to use it!  \n\nIn three.js **colors** are stored in the **HEX format**, that is that they are made up from 3 different sections.  \nThe first 2 decide the **red** value, the other 2 the **green** and the final 2 the **blue**!\n\nBut you might say, and rightfully so, why do they start with `0x` and not `#` as like they are defined most of the time in web development?  \nThat is because `0x` defines that the value will be hex, and because JS doesn't natively support starting elements with `#` it is used instead of it.\n\n**TIP**\nYou may reuse the material for more than one cube, but if you want a different color ( or texture in the future ) split them into different variable.\ni.e. All wood blocks would use a woodMaterial but glass will use a glass material.\n\n#### Adding it to our scene\nIf you click the run button now tho, you will see that the cube we made isn't visible in the scene! But why is that?\n\nWell that issue occurs because we **initialized** our cube, but not **added it** to the scene.\nYou see by initalizing something, you just create it in the computers **memory** but not added it to our virtual animation **world** also known as **scene**.\n\nHere is a quick real life analogy, so we can understand it better.\n\nIf you think about it a pizza perfectly **resembles** our cube, because we can define it' shape,  the `BoxGeometry` in our cube, and it's toppings, the `MeshBasicMaterial` in our cube.\nBut if we don't put it in the oven how are we going to bake it!\n\nJust like pizza we must \"bake\" our cube, to \"bake\" our cube we need to put it in our virtual oven, the scene!\nIn the **run arrow function** add the following lines:\n\n```js\nscene.add(cube);\n```\n\nNow try clicking the RUN button on the browser after reloading, do you see the cube?\n\nTry changing the THREE.BoxGeometry and the color of the material, do you see the cube size changing?\n\n### Changing the position and rotation\n\nNow let's try to change the cube position and rotation.\nEach Three object has a position and rotation field, which each of them contains a xyz property.\n\nAfter adding the cube to the scene copy this code before the `renderer.render`:\n\n```js\ncube.position.x = 1;\ncube.position.y = -1;\ncube.rotation.x = 1;\n```\n\n#### The Rotation Unit\n\nTHREE.JS like some other 3d modelling tools, use **radians** for rotation.  \nThis sadly makes it a bit hard to rotate objects for people who aren't used for them.  \nThankfully three.js has a **math** function that will let us **convert** degrees to radians without thinking much!\n\n```js\nTHREE.MathUtils.degToRad(deg)\n```\n\nJust replace `deg` with the degrees you want. i.e. `180`\n\nLet's see a more in depth example:\n```js\ncube.rotation.x = THREE.MathUtils.degToRad(90) // Rotate the X axis by 90 degrees\ncube.rotation.z = THREE.MathUtils.degToRad(45) // Rotate the Z axis by 45 degrees\n```\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"Optional Task\"\u003e\n\tDo you see the cube? Chaning it's position and rotation?\n\tAfter completion feel free to delete the lines if needed.\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n### Animating the cube\n\nThe final piece of this section is the actual animation.\nIn the function seen below, which has already been implemented for your convenience, thank me later :)\n\n```js\n// Animate Scene\nlet tick = 0;\nfunction animate() {\n    requestAnimationFrame(animate);\n    // ANIMATE STUFF HERE\n    renderer.render(scene, camera);\n    tick++;\n}\n```\n\nHere we add a `tick` variable where we keep **track** of the time, this variable gets increased at the end of the function.\nThen we request the frame, and render it.\n\nNow we also need to call the function somewhere, because the function never terminates, a **smart** location to **place** it is at the end of the start function!\n\nLet's make the cube rotate constantly!\nAfter the `requestAnimationFrame` copy this code:\n\n```js\ncube.rotation.x += 0.1;\n```\n\nThis code increases the cubes X axis rotation by .1 radians.\n\nNow after that add copy this code below:\n\n```js\nif (tick % 64 \u003e 31) {\n    cube.position.x += 0.1;\n} else {\n    cube.position.x -= 0.1;\n}\n```\n\nThis code changes the cubes x position by 0.1 and then by -0.1. But why is that?\n\n#### Explaining the formula\nThis might be a boring but necessary explanation, please **bare with me for a bit.**.\n\nWell behind the `tick % 64 \u003e 31` formula is a really smart way to do consistent rotation.  \nLet's start by dissecting the first part, `tick % 64`.  If you think about it, the animation goes on forever, each frame the `tick` variable will be increased by 1. That is great for animations that stop after a while but for continuous animations there is a flaw, because we can't check if the tick is less than a value, let's say `32` more than one time.  \n\n**But!** with the modulo(`%`) operator we can, since every time we use it with a number, i.e. `64`, the values will **always** be from the range of 0 to 63, no other exceptions. We can use that to our **advantage**, since half of the time (0 to 30) we will be going right and the other half of the time (31 to 63) we will go the other way, cancelling each other out!\n\nNow \n\u003cDropdown title=\"Task\"\u003e\n\tTry fiddling with it! Change values, add rotation, go \u003cstrong\u003eas crazy as your heart desires\u003c/strong\u003e!\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\nWell it is task time everyone!\n![time_meme-dot-jpg](https://cloud-qmjjp049v-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0meme_time.jpg)\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"Task\"\u003e\n\tAdd 2 of your own cubes into the scene!\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n## Add Picture as cube surface\n\nYes you heard that right! Forget the boring colors, let's add real textures!\nFirst upload your picture via dragging and dropping it in the `assets/` folder.\nI will name mine `cube.jpg`\n\nFirst we need to create a loader to **load** the image.\nCopy this code above the materials.\n\n```js\nconst loader = new THREE.TextureLoader();\n```\n\nThis just creates a loader, now we need to _import_ the images.\n\nIn the cube material replace the:\n`color: 0x000000`, with: `map: loader.load('assets/cube.png')`\n\ni.e.\n\n```js\nconst cubeMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ map: loader.load('assets/cube.png') });\n```\n\nThat is **it**! Wasn't that easy?\n\n## Three.js must haves\n\nHere are some features that you **must have** in your applciation.\n\n### Skybox\n\nWell a black void is boring, I hope we can all agree with that!\nA skybox was already in the template in the `assets/skybox.png` :D\nIsn't that handy, you may replace it of course!\n\nNow between the loader and the materials copy this code:\n\n```js\nscene.background = loader.load(\"assets/skybox.jpg\");\n```\n\nThis will set the background to the `assets/skybox.png`, isn't that **handy**!\n\n**TIP: Make sure if you have time to find your own skybox, as to make your animation unique and to have a touch of your own personality! A place I have been using for a while now for skyboxes is Unsplashed, check it out! If you don't have time, feel free to keep using the default one.**\n\n### Background Audio\n\nNow let's add some audio.\nThe audio takes place at the end of the run arrow function, just **before** the animate\nCopy this code into there:\n\n```js\nconst listener = new THREE.AudioListener(); // We create the listener\nconst soundSettings = new THREE.Audio(listener); // \u003e\u003e \u003e\u003e the audio settings\nconst audioLoader = new THREE.AudioLoader(); // \u003e\u003e \u003e\u003e the audio loader, so we can load the bg\ncamera.add(listener); // We attach it to the camera\n\naudioLoader.load(\"assets/bg.mp3\", function (buffer) {\n    soundSettings.setBuffer(buffer);\n    soundSettings.setLoop(true); // Set the audio to loop\n    soundSettings.setVolume(0.5); // Audio volume\n    soundSettings.play(); // Play Audio\n});\n```\n\nWell that is it!\nIt will play the `bg.mp3` that is located in the `assets` folder!\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"Optional Task\"\u003e\n\tFind your own background lofi music and import it into your project, so you can play it instead.\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n### Camera rotations\n\nI think we can agree that static cameras are boring so let's make ours to rotate!\n\nSo what are you waiting! After the initialising the render copy these lines:\n\n```js\n// Controls\nconst controls = new OrbitControls(camera, renderer.domElement); // Create control\ncontrols.target.set(0, 0.5, 0); // Set target\ncontrols.update(); // Update it\ncontrols.enablePan = false; // Disable pan\ncontrols.enableDamping = true; // Enable damping\n```\n\nNow the last thing we need to do is call it at the end of our render function!\nJust copy this line, before the render!\n\n```js\ncontrols.update();\n```\n\nCongrats! Now you can rotate the camera! Isn't that fun!\n\nWe are **so near** the end of our sessions so please wait a bit more before you can master Voxel animations :D\n\n## The recording\n\nPhew it is almost time for your solo adventure.\n\n### Adding the capturer\n\nWell the first thing we need to do is add the capturer, so we can use it. Copy this code just after the imports:\n\n```js\nvar capturer = new CCapture({\n    format: \"webm\",\n    workersPath: \"/lib/\",\n    verbose: true,\n    framerate: 60,\n}); // Format may be: GIF, WEBM, PNG, JPG\n```\n\nFeel free to change the video format.\n\nNow we need to add one more line just before the `renderer.render` function call on the `animate` method. Copy this line:\n\n```js\ncapturer.capture(renderer.domElement);\n```\n\n### Start the recording\n\nTo start the recording it is very simple!\nOn the `Executed on start rec` comment copy these lines:\n\n```js\ncapturer.start(); // Start the capturer\nstatusRec.innerText = \"Recording in progress\"; // Update the status\n```\n\nWell that is everything you need to add to start the recording, now let's end and save it.\n\n### Stop the recording\n\nWell again on the `Executed on stop rec` comment copy these lines:\n\n```js\ncapturer.stop(); // Stop rhe capturer\ncapturer.save(); // Save the recording\nstatusRec.innerText = \"Saving recording... This *may* take a while\"; // Update status\n```\n\n**WARNING FOR ADVENTURERS: THE CAPTURE FUNCTIONALITY WORKS ONLY WHEN THE PREVIEW IS OUTSIDE REPLIT**.\n\n## Start of your SOLO adventure\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"Final Task\"\u003e\n\tCreate a ground for your project.\u003cbr/\u003e\n\tIt can either use a texture or a green color, like 0x00FF00.\u003cbr/\u003e\n\tMake sure to make the y \u003cstrong\u003enegative\u003c/strong\u003e, or make the other objects y \u003cstrong\u003epositive\u003c/strong\u003e!\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\nIt is finally time!

If you have more time, you are free to check them out.\n\n---\n\n## 3D Models\n\nWell hello there!\nIt looks like you wanted to learn more, let's start with 3D models.\n\n### Creating your own 3D model\n\nI suggest using [this]([Goxel 0.10.5](https://goxel.xyz/live/)) tool for creating a 3D voxel model, because it is easy to use and it is **online**.\nAfter creating a model follow this guide:\n![export](https://cloud-de7xkh2bp-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\nInstructions as show above:\n\n1. Click the image button, it is known as **export**\n2. Click the `export as` dropdown\n3. Click `Wavefront (.obj)`\n\nAfter clicking export, save and upload the `.obj`\nThen upload it into the `assets/` folder.\n\n### Loading the model\n\nNow upload the model loader, copy this line after the texture loader.\n\n```js\nconst modelLoader = new OBJLoader();\n```\n\nThen after all of the `scene.add` calls, load the model like this, change the `name.obj` to your `.obj` name.\n\n```js\nmodelLoader.load(\n    \"assets/name.obj\",\n    (obj) =\u003e {\n        console.log(\"Model: NAME, loaded\");\n        // Change position, rotation, scale here\n        obj.position.x = -1;\n        scene.add(obj);\n    },\n    undefined,\n    undefined\n);\n```\n\nWell that is it for loading 3D models!\nYou should now see it, but we have a slight problem, uhhh, it is a bit oversized isn't it, let's fix that.\n\n## Object Lighting and Scaling\n\n### Scaling\n\nAs you saw the model is a bit **too large** to fit in to the scene, so let's change its scale.\nOn the arrow function change you can manipulate its position, rotation or scale!\n\nTo scale you will use the `.scale.set(x, y, z)` method.\ni.e.\n\n```js\nobj.scale.set(0.1, 0.1, 0.1); // Set's the object xyz scale to .1\n```\n\nNow let's implement it to the model:\n\n```js\nmodelLoader.load(\n    \"assets/name.obj\",\n    (obj) =\u003e {\n        console.log(\"Model: NAME, loaded\");\n        // Change position, rotation, scale here\n        obj.position.x = -1;\n        obj.scale.set(0.1, 0.1, 0.1);\n        scene.add(obj);\n    },\n    undefined,\n    undefined\n);\n```\n\nThat should be it, but uhhh, new issue.\nThe model is black, without any color.\n\n### Lighting\n\nWell to see it, you need lighting! :D\n\nFor that THREE.JS has a light object, here is how to declare and add it in the scene.\nCopy this code at the end of the `scene.add` calls:\n\n```js\nscene.add(new THREE.AmbientLight(0xFFFFFF, 1)); // Add light so we can see the models\n```\n\nWell now you should be able to see the models!\nAnd you now have reached the end! Congrats! I hope you make a **fine and awesome** jam.\nI know you can do it!\n"

Both ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion  are completely free. Lastly, we'll walk through deploying your comic as a website (yes, with a live URL :)) so you can share it with your friends 🌎\n\nThis jam will take you from 0 to a ChatGPT and AI model \"Hero\":\n![](https://cloud-a10rlmpqz-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nAs an example, here is an example of what your finished storybook may look like ([alex-gets-his-private-pilot-license.ganningxu.repl.co](https://alex-gets-his-private-pilot-license.ganningxu.repl.co))!\n\n![](https://cloud-d9ibqv1p3-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screen_recording_2023-08-01_at_12.26.59_pm__2_.gif)\n\nIf you're interested, here's another comic that I made with ChatGPT and DALL-E ([robotics-mayhem.ganningxu.repl.co](https://robotics-mayhem.ganningxu.repl.co/))\n![](https://cloud-dau1tq7mx-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screen_recording_2023-08-08_at_7.06.00_pm.gif)\n\nKeep in mind that your result will be completely different. In fact, if it is the same, you're probably doing something wrong :) With that said, here are some resources that you may find helpful!\n\n**Link to demo**: https://alex-gets-his-private-pilot-license.ganningxu.repl.co\n\n**Comic Site HTML Template (you'll need this to o build your site)**: https://replit.com/@GanningXu/ComicAiSiteTemplate?v=1\n\n**ChatGPT** https://chat.openai.com\n\n**Stable Diffusion**: https://stablediffusionweb.com/#demo\n\n**Outline**\n- **Basics of Prompt Engineering**\n    - Proven prompt engineering techinques (and challenges!)\n    - Small *friendly (or not)* competition to generate the funniest dad jokes :O \n- **Brainstorm** to come up with the plot of your comic\n- Using **ChatGPT**, create the text content for your 8-section comic\n- For each of the 8 sections, use **Stable Diffusion** to generate a corresponding picture\n- Taking Stable Diffussion's pictures and ChatGPT's outline, and create a **comic book website**!\n\n## Prompt Engineering\nBy now, I'm sure you've heard of what \"AI\" and ChatGPT are. While most people don't think twice about what question they feed into Large Language Models like ChatGPT, there's actually a whole field of study dedicated to making the perfect input prompt---**[prompt engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering)**---which focuses on fine-tuning user-input to better shape the response of AI models. \n\n\u003e 💡 In fact, [OpenAI also made a course on prompt engineering](https://medium.com/geekculture/prompt-engineering-course-openai-inferring-transforming-expanding-chatgpt-chatgpt4-e5f63132f422).\n\nBefore diving into specific techniques, we'll cover some \"quick facts\" about prompting:\n- Quality of results often depends on **how much information** the prompt provides, and **how well-crafted** it is\n- A typical prompt will contain the following elements:\n    - **Instruction:** what you want the model to do\n    - **Context:** what background knowledge you want the model to have\n    - **Input Data:** question that we are interested in the response for\n    - **Output Indicator:** the type/format of the output\n- In the \"instruction\", use specific verbs like \"write\", \"classify\", \"translate\", \"summarize\", etc\n- Be very clear and specific on the task you want the model to perform\n    - The more detailed your prompt, the better the answer will be\n- Instead of saying what \"not to do\", tell the model what \"to do\"\n\nFor more information on prompting basics, check out [promptingguide.ai](https://www.promptingguide.ai/introduction/basics).\n\nNext, we'll cover some common prompt engineering techniques. For each section, there will be a small challenge. You'll share your responses to each section on a Google Form that the club leader shares with you. You'll also have access to other people's responses, to stalk---I mean learn.\n\nNow, let's go into some specifics!\n![](https://cloud-o5nnqusk0-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0giphy.gif)\n\n### Zero-Shot Prompting\n\u003e ❓ Using zero-shot prompting, come up with a sentence of your own and ask ChatGPT to classify it as spam or safe :)\n\n\u003e 🤔 Share your responses and ChatGPT's output on the propmting Google Form that your club leader will share with you\n\nZSP is essentially giving the model no \"training\" before asking it a question. This \"technique\" is what most people use. \n\nFor example, try the following prompt, and come up with your own:\n```w!\n**User**\nClassify the text into neutral, negative or positive. \nText: I think the vacation is okay.\nSentiment:\n\n**ChatGPT**\nNeutral\n```\n\nWhile this will work for common problems, it may fail on more unique prompts.\n\n### Few-Shot Prompting\n\u003e ❓ Using few-shot prompting, ask ChatGPT to output \"yes\" or \"no\", based on whether the following words are examples of physical activity. The words are \"running\" and \"diving\" However, you cannot tell ChatGPT that it needs to classify for physical activity. Come up with a few examples, like:\n\n```w!\n**User**\nSwimming | yes\nWalking | yes\nSitting | no\nRunning | \nDiving | \n```\n\nFSP relies on the user providing a couple of examples of expected output to the model, before asking the model to produce its own. If you think about it, giving the model some training examples is very similar to how a human learns. For example:\n\n```w!\n**User**\nA \"whatpu\" is a small, furry animal native to Tanzania. An example of a sentence that uses\nthe word whatpu is:\nWe were traveling in Africa and we saw these very cute whatpus.\nTo do a \"farduddle\" means to jump up and down really fast. An example of a sentence that uses\nthe word farduddle is:\n\n**ChatGPT***\nWhen we won the game, we all started to farduddle in celebration.\n```\n\n### Chain-of-Thought Prompting\n\u003e ❓ Using chain-of-thought prompting, see if you can get ChatGPT to explain the hidden meaning behind a difficult-to-read poem from English class\n\nWhen using Chain-of-Thought prompting, you'll want to ask the model to **explain the intermediate reasoning steps** before giving the final answer. \n\nHere's an [example](https://towardsdatascience.com/prompt-engineering-guide-for-data-analysts-54f480ba4d98):\n![](https://cloud-6v5c2pm6e-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nTelling the model to solve it \"step by step\" helps it **think through its own answer**, giving more accurate results.\n\nHere's [another example](https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/05/language-models-perform-reasoning-via.html) (note that you can also \"show\" the model what step by step looks like):\n![](https://cloud-aaphlohmn-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\n### Generated Knowledge Prompting\n\u003e ❓ Using generated knowledge prompting, get ChatGPT to write a three paragraph essay on why comics and AI belong together. \n\n\u003e 🤔 Remember to keep posting these into the Google Form your club leader sent you!\n\nYou can think of [GKP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.08387.pdf) as the model **\"searching for information itself\"**. Here, you ask the model to provide the most relevant facts related to a topic, and then ask the model to generate an answer based on these facts.\n\nThese two screenshots are one example of GKP.\n\n[Generating the information](https://towardsdatascience.com/prompt-engineering-guide-for-data-analysts-54f480ba4d98) (\"the search\"):\n![](https://cloud-7rs0kqnrj-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\n[Using information to make answer](https://towardsdatascience.com/prompt-engineering-guide-for-data-analysts-54f480ba4d98) (\"the answer\"):\n![](https://cloud-5gt4oyd57-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\n### Self-Refine Prompting\n\u003e ❓ Using self-refine prompting, ask ChatGPT to generate a function (in your choice of programming language) to play the game [fizzbuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz#:~:text=Fizz%20buzz%20is%20a%20group,with%20the%20word%20%22fizzbuzz%22.). Though arguably Python is the best language hehe\n\n![](https://cloud-lfhygu0v3-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0coding.gif)\n\nYou can think of SFP as the model \"teaching itself\". First, the user asks the model to provide an initial solution. Next, the user asks the model for problems with its original solution. Afterward, the user prompts the model to address the problems in its solution. This process can repeat until the user is happy with the result.\n\nFor example:\n```w!\n**User**\ncome up with a short positive review for a cactus I bought from amazon\n\n**ChatGPT**\nAbsolutely thrilled with my Amazon cactus purchase! 🌵 It arrived in perfect condition and looks stunning on my desk. Low-maintenance and full of character, it adds a delightful touch of nature to my workspace. Highly recommend for anyone seeking a charming and easy-to-care-for plant companion! 🌿👍\n\n**User**\nwhere is this review lacking?\n\n**ChatGPT**\nWhile the short positive review covers some important points, it could benefit from a few improvements to make it more comprehensive and informative:\n\nDescription of the cactus: The review doesn't provide specific details about the cactus's type or any distinctive features. Adding a sentence or two about the cactus's appearance, such as its size, shape, or unique characteristics, would give readers a better idea of what to expect.\n\nPersonal experience: While the review mentions being \"absolutely thrilled\" with the purchase, it doesn't elaborate on the reasons for the excitement. Sharing a brief personal experience with the cactus, such as how it has enhanced the workspace or brought joy, would make the review more relatable and engaging.\n\nLong-term satisfaction: The review doesn't mention how long the cactus has been owned or whether it has maintained its appearance and health over time. Including a comment on the cactus's longevity and continued satisfaction would add value to the review.\n\nComparison with other cacti or plants: Adding a few words about how this cactus compares to others the reviewer might have owned or seen in terms of ease of care, aesthetics, or uniqueness would make the review more informative for potential buyers.\n\nBy incorporating these elements, the review could become more well-rounded and provide potential buyers with a more complete and helpful perspective on the Amazon cactus purchase.\n\n**User**\nincorporate this feedback into your original short positive review\n\n**ChatGPT**\nAbsolutely thrilled with my Amazon cactus purchase! 🌵 The Golden Barrel cactus arrived in perfect condition, boasting a delightful round shape and vibrant green color that looks stunning on my desk. Low-maintenance and full of character, it adds a delightful touch of nature to my workspace, brightening up my day with its charm. I've had it for several months now, and it has maintained its health and appearance beautifully, making it a long-term source of joy. Compared to other cacti I've owned, this one stands out for its ease of care and unique aesthetics. Highly recommend for anyone seeking a charming and easy-to-care-for plant companion! 🌿👍\n```\n\n### Tree-of-Thought Prompting\n\u003e ❓ Since tree of thought prompting is a bit more difficult than the others to use, we challenge you to come up with a scenario in which tree prompting could be very useful. Maybe even feed it to ChatGPT. \n\nTOT is structured just like you think it would! First, the user asks the model to provide possible solutions to a problem. Next, the user asks the model to \"run through\" each of those solutions, to figure out the best one. \n\nHere's an example of a [ToT prompt](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/tot):\n```w!\nImagine three different experts are answering this question.\nAll experts will write down 1 step of their thinking,\nthen share it with the group.\nThen all experts will go on to the next step, etc.\nIf any expert realises they're wrong at any point then they leave.\nThe question is...\n```\n\nChatGPT's response:\n```w!\nExpert 1: The ball is in the living room.\n\nExpert 2: The ball is in the kitchen.\n\nExpert 3: The ball is in the bedroom.\n\nExpert 1: Bob carries the cup to the bedroom, so the ball must be in the cup.\n\nExpert 2: Oh, I see my mistake. Yes, the ball is in the cup.\n\nExpert 3: Agreed, the ball is in the cup in the bedroom.\n\nExpert 1: Next, Bob turns the cup upside down in the bedroom.\n\nExpert 2: After that, Bob walks to the garden and puts the cup down.\n\nExpert 3: Therefore, the ball must have fallen out of the cup when Bob turned it upside down in the bedroom. So, the ball is in the bedroom, not in the cup anymore.\n\nExpert 1: Oh, you're right. I made a mistake. The ball is in the bedroom, not in the cup.\n\nExpert 2: Agreed, the ball is in the bedroom.\n\nExpert 3: Bob then walks to the garage, so the ball remains in the bedroom. It is not in the garden or the garage.\n\nExpert 1: Absolutely, the ball is still in the bedroom.\n\nExpert 2: Yes, the ball hasn't moved from the bedroom.\n\nExpert 3: Therefore, the ball is in the bedroom, not in the garden or the garage.\n\nAll three experts agree that the ball is in the bedroom.\n```\n\n## DAD JOKE COMPETITION\nAHA you didn't think you could skip this, did you \u003e:) Here are the rules. Using the prompting techniques from above, generate five of your best dad jokes.\n\n![](https://cloud-54mgddtet-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nYour club leader will send a Google Form to everyone. At the end of the **five minutes**, submit your five jokes.\n\nNext, the club leader will share the responses spreadsheet. Please vote for the top 3 best jokes (no voting for your own).\n\n***GOOD LUCK!***\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n    \u003csummary\u003eIf you're interested, here's the prompt I used (using Chain of Thought prompting)\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n```w!\n**User**\ngenerate 5 dad jokes for me. explain why each of them are funny and how you got to each one\n\n**ChatGPT**\nSure, here are five dad jokes for you:\n\nWhy don't scientists trust atoms?\nBecause they make up everything!\nExplanation: This joke is a play on words. \"Atoms\" make up everything in the physical world, but the punchline humorously suggests that they are untrustworthy as they \"make up\" stories or lies.\n\nDid you hear about the kidnapping at the playground?\nHe woke up!\nExplanation: This joke uses a pun to create humor. The word \"kidnapping\" is used in a misleading way, making the listener think it refers to a serious event. But, the punchline reveals that it's about a child taking a nap at the playground, using \"woke up\" in its colloquial sense.\n\nWhat do you call fake spaghetti?\nAn impasta!\nExplanation: This joke is a classic example of a pun. The word \"impasta\" sounds similar to \"impostor,\" but it humorously refers to fake spaghetti rather than a person.\n\nWhy don't some couples go to the gym?\nBecause some relationships don't work out!\nExplanation: This joke uses a play on words. \"Work out\" usually refers to going to the gym to exercise, but in the context of relationships, it means that some couples don't succeed or \"work out\" together.\n\nWhy did the scarecrow win an award?\nBecause he was outstanding in his field!\nExplanation: This joke is a clever play on words. The phrase \"outstanding in his field\" is usually used to describe someone who excels in their profession or area of expertise. In this joke, it takes a literal interpretation, as the scarecrow is literally standing in a field.\n\nDad jokes often rely on puns, wordplay, and clever twists on common phrases or sayings to create a lighthearted and cheesy sense of humor. They are intentionally simple and cheesy, designed to elicit groans and eye-rolls from the audience, making them a favorite form of humor for many dads and joke enthusiasts alike.\n```\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\n## 🧠 Brainstorming\nNow onto the comic book! Take the next five minutes and come up with what you want the broad topic of your comic book to be about. Some of my (ehhrmm, or ChatGPT's)\n\n1. **Fantasy Quest**: Follow the adventures of a group of unlikely heroes as they embark on a quest to save their world from an ancient evil. Along the way, they encounter mythical creatures, magical artifacts, and test the limits of their friendship and bravery.\n2. **Space Explorers**: Set in the distant future, a team of intrepid astronauts explores uncharted regions of the universe, encountering alien civilizations, cosmic mysteries, and discovering the wonders and dangers of deep space.\n3. **Magical Academy**: Attend a prestigious school for young wizards and witches as they learn to master their magical abilities. Follow their misadventures, magical duels, and the challenges they face while navigating the complexities of both the magical and human worlds.\n\nThe idea I'll be using for the rest of this jam will be about a student who wants to get his privte pilot license!\n\n## Creating the Comic Book Outline\nSweet! Now that you have a general idea of what you want your comic to be about, we'll use ChatGPT to create a more detailed outline.\n\nOur comic will be 8 text sections, and have 8 corrosponding pictures.\n\n\nUsing one of the prompt engineering techniques above, use your topic and ask ChatGPT for a an outline for the 8 sections of your comic. \n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n    \u003csummary\u003e\n        Open this up to see my comic outline!\n    \u003c/summary\u003e\n    \nSection 1: **Introduction**\nMeet Alex, a passionate high school student in North Carolina who dreams of earning his private pilot license and is inspired by his aviation enthusiast father.

As he researches flight schools and requirements, he seeks guidance from his father and the local aviation community, discovering the support and encouragement they offer.\n\nSection 3: **Flight School Adventures**\nAlex enrolls in a reputable local flight school, where he meets his flight instructor, Captain Johnson, who is known for his strict yet caring teaching style. Alex also befriends fellow aviation enthusiasts, Sarah and Mike, who become his study buddies and support system. As they bond over their shared passion, the friendship among the trio deepens.\n\nSection 4: **Challenges and Doubts**\nFlight training proves to be more challenging than Alex anticipated. He faces setbacks, struggles with complex concepts, and experiences moments of self-doubt. However, his determination and the encouragement from his family and friends keep him going. Through their support, he learns to overcome his doubts and embrace the learning process.\n\nSection 5: **Solo Flight**\nAfter weeks of training, Alex faces a significant milestone – his first solo flight. The mixture of excitement and nervousness consumes him as he takes control of the aircraft alone, realizing the responsibility and freedom that comes with flying solo. This pivotal moment marks a turning point in his journey, boosting his confidence and reinforcing his passion for aviation.\n\nSection 6: **Flight Test Preparation**\nAs the flight test date approaches, Alex's anxiety mounts, and he dedicates every spare moment to practice with Captain Johnson. He also learns valuable life lessons about perseverance, discipline, and the importance of staying calm under pressure. With Captain Johnson's mentorship, he hones his skills, building his confidence for the upcoming test.\n\nSection 7: **Overcoming Obstacles**\nOn the day of the flight test, unexpected weather conditions challenge Alex's skills and decision-making. He must navigate through turbulence, demonstrating his proficiency as a pilot while keeping his composure in difficult situations. The test pushes him to apply everything he's learned, revealing his growth as a pilot and an individual.\n\nSection 8: **Achieving Success**\nDespite the challenges faced during the flight test, Alex successfully completes it and earns his private pilot license.

Happy comic-making!\n\n\n\n\n**User**\nWhere is this outline lacking?\n\n**ChatGPT**\nThe outline provides a general structure for the comic, but it could benefit from some additional elements to enhance the storytelling and character development. Here are some areas where the outline could be further improved:\n\nCharacter Development: The outline briefly introduces the protagonist, Alex, but it could delve deeper into his personality, motivations, and personal challenges. Adding more depth to his character will make readers more invested in his journey.\n\nSupporting Characters: Consider introducing supporting characters such as Alex's friends, family, or fellow students at the flight school. These characters can provide a support system for Alex and add more dynamics to the story.\n\nConflict and Plot Twists: While the outline mentions challenges during flight training and unexpected weather conditions, it could benefit from additional plot twists and conflicts that Alex must overcome, making the story more engaging and unpredictable.\n\nEmotional Arc: Think about incorporating emotional highs and lows throughout the comic. This can include moments of triumph, self-doubt, determination, and moments of joy and accomplishment.\n\nAviation Themes: Since the comic is about a student earning his private pilot license, consider highlighting specific aviation-related themes and details to add authenticity and interest to the story.\n\nArt Style and Settings: Although not explicitly mentioned in the outline, consider how the art style will complement the story and help set the scene for each section. Visual details can enhance the overall storytelling experience.\n\nBy expanding on these aspects, the comic will become more immersive and resonate with readers on a deeper level. The additional details will create a more well-rounded and engaging narrative that captures the journey of a high school student pursuing his dream of becoming a pilot.\n\n\n\n\n**User**\nincorporate this feedback into the original 8 section outline, with 1-2 sentences per section\n\n**ChatGPT**\nSure, let's incorporate the feedback into the original 8 section outline:\n\nSection 1: Introduction\nMeet Alex, a passionate high school student in North Carolina who dreams of earning his private pilot license and is inspired by his aviation enthusiast father.

In our digital magic show, that creature is a 3D duck.🦆✨\n\n**The Magical Treasure Chest**\n\nFirst, we need a place to store our magical entities, our 3D models.\n\n```html\n    \u003ca-assets\u003e\n      \u003ca-asset-item id=\"animated-asset\" src=\"demo.gltf\"\u003e\u003c/a-asset-item\u003e\n    \u003c/a-assets\u003e\n```\n\nThis is our magical treasure chest, holding our precious 3D duck.\n\n**The Magic Circle**\n\nNext, we draw our magic circle. Whenever someone activates this circle (using a specific marker), our magic comes to life!\n\n```html\n    \u003ca-marker id=\"animated-marker\" type=\"pattern\" preset=\"custom\" url=\"marker.patt\" raycaster=\"objects: .clickable\"\n      emitevents=\"true\" cursor=\"fuse: false; rayOrigin: mouse;\" id=\"markerA\"\u003e\n      \u003ca-entity id=\"bowser-model\" scale=\"0.4 0.4 0.4\" animation-mixer=\"loop: repeat\" gltf-model=\"#animated-asset\"\n        class=\"clickable\" gesture-handler\u003e\u003c/a-entity\u003e\n    \u003c/a-marker\u003e\n```\n\n**The Magician's Eye**\n\nEvery magician needs a way to see and interact with his audience. That's what the magical camera is for:\n\n```html\n    \u003ca-entity camera\u003e\u003c/a-entity\u003e\n```\n\nWith the cursor, we can point, choose, and interact, just as a magician might use a wand!\n\n**The Magical Scroll**\n\nLastly, the magician leaves a message, guiding the audience on how to partake in the magic:\n\n```html\n\u003ca-text value=\"Please point your camera at the custom HackClub marker.\" align=\"center\" position=\"0 -0.5 -1.5\"\n      color=\"red\" visible=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/a-text\u003e\n```\n\n![https://cloud-4vl3zrzew-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1image__4_.gif](https://cloud-4vl3zrzew-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1image__4_.gif)\n\nWhen these ingredients come together in our digital cauldron, a delightful AR experience is brewed! The 3D duck majestically appears, twirling and spinning in all its glory. Every magician has more than one trick up their sleeve, and so will we! Stay tuned!🎩🔮\n\nIf you've followed the steps to the letter, the enchantments inside your **`\u003cbody\u003e`** tag should now look like this. If they don't, fear not! Even the most seasoned magic-makers sometimes stumble. Take a moment to retrace your steps, realign your magic symbols, and let's try the spell within the **`\u003cbody\u003e`** realm again!\n\n```html\n  \u003ca-scene vr-mode-ui=\"enabled: false;\" loading-screen=\"enabled: false;\" renderer=\"logarithmicDepthBuffer: true;\"\n    arjs=\"trackingMethod: best; sourceType: webcam; debugUIEnabled: false;\" id=\"scene\" embedded gesture-detector\u003e\n    \u003ca-assets\u003e\n      \u003ca-asset-item id=\"animated-asset\" src=\"demo.gltf\"\u003e\u003c/a-asset-item\u003e\n    \u003c/a-assets\u003e\n\n    \u003ca-marker id=\"animated-marker\" type=\"pattern\" preset=\"custom\" url=\"marker.patt\" raycaster=\"objects: .clickable\"\n      emitevents=\"true\" cursor=\"fuse: false; rayOrigin: mouse;\" id=\"markerA\"\u003e\n      \u003ca-entity id=\"bowser-model\" scale=\"0.4 0.4 0.4\" animation-mixer=\"loop: repeat\" gltf-model=\"#animated-asset\"\n        class=\"clickable\" gesture-handler\u003e\u003c/a-entity\u003e\n    \u003c/a-marker\u003e\n\n    \u003ca-entity camera\u003e\u003c/a-entity\u003e\n  \u003c/a-scene\u003e\n\n```\n\n### 3. Unleashing Multiple AR Entities (optional)\n\nAlright, conjuring one 3D duck is cool, but you know what's cooler? Conjuring multiple 3D entities! Each entity will be linked to a different marker, leading to an entirely new model. It's like having multiple magic tricks up your sleeve!\n\n```html\n  \u003ca-scene embedded arjs\u003e\n    \u003ca-assets\u003e\n      \u003ca-asset-item id=\"duck-model\" src=\"Duck.gltf\"\u003e\u003c/a-asset-item\u003e\n      \u003ca-asset-item id=\"another-model\" src=\"AnotherModel.gltf\"\u003e\u003c/a-asset-item\u003e\n    \u003c/a-assets\u003e\n    \u003ca-marker preset=\"hiro\"\u003e\n      \u003ca-entity id=\"duck\" gltf-model=\"#duck-model\" scale=\"0.3 0.3 0.3\"\n        animation=\"property: rotation; to: 0 360 0; loop: true; dur: 10000; startEvents: spin\"\u003e\n      \u003c/a-entity\u003e\n    \u003c/a-marker\u003e\n    \u003ca-marker preset=\"kanji\"\u003e\n      \u003ca-entity id=\"another-entity\" gltf-model=\"#another-model\" scale=\"0.3 0.3 0.3\"\n        animation=\"property: rotation; to: 0 360 0; loop: true; dur: 10000; startEvents: spin\"\u003e\n      \u003c/a-entity\u003e\n    \u003c/a-marker\u003e\n    \u003ca-entity camera\u003e\n      \u003ca-cursor\u003e\u003c/a-cursor\u003e\n      \u003ca-text value=\"Please point your camera at the Hiro or Kanji marker.\" align=\"center\" position=\"0 -0.5 -1.5\"\n        color=\"red\" visible=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/a-text\u003e\n    \u003c/a-entity\u003e\n  \u003c/a-scene\u003e\n\n```\n\n## What Did We Learn?\n\nWe've now built a basic AR application with multiple 3D models, and we didn't even need goofy glasses! Not only do we know how to set up an AR scene, but we can also add multiple 3D models to the scene and make them come alive. We've mastered the basics and we're ready to create our own digital universe. Remember, in the world of AR, the only limit is your imagination. Keep coding and keep exploring!\n\n![https://cloud-4vl3zrzew-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image__5_.gif](https://cloud-4vl3zrzew-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image__5_.gif)"

[Wizard Orpheus](https://github.com/hackclub/wizard-orpheus) is a JavaScript library that makes it easy peasy to build AI apps in JavaScript with minimal prior knowledge!\n\nYou will get to come up with your own story, game variables, and fun mechanics. The Jam concept \u0026 library was made by [Zach Latta](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U0266FRGP) (founder of Hack Club) and the slides / document were produced by [Thomas](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U041FQB8VK2).\n\n**Outline:**\n1. **Fork and Run Replit**\n2. **Add ability for users to send a message**\n3. **Add ability for bot to respond**\n4. **Create a variable to keep score**\n5. **Update the background with variables** \n6. **Customize prompt to make your own game**\n\n## Fork \u0026 Run Replit \nVisit [hack.club/wow-starter](https://hack.club/wow-starter\n) and tap Fork \u0026 Run. You'll need to create a Replit account for this to work. \n\n![Wizard Orpheus Fork \u0026 Run Gif](https://cloud-rfnb1efui-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0wizard-orpheus-fork-and-run.gif)\n## Add ability for users to send a message\nCurrently when the user taps enter... \n![user tapping enter](https://cloud-wd3hweveh-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0noenter.gif)\n\nIt does not send the message! Let's change that\n\nLet's go into our script.js file. \n\nIn that file, beneath our prompt (on the first line), let's add this section of code\n\n```\nmyGame.createUserAction({\n  name: 'message',\n  parameters: ['Message from user to game'],\n  howBotShouldHandle: 'Respond to the user'\n})\n\ndocument.getElementById('input').addEventListener('keyup', function(e) {\n  if (e.code == 'Enter') { // if the user presses enter\n    let userInput = document.getElementById('input').value\n    myGame.message(userInput)\n\n    document.getElementById('conversation').innerHTML += '\u003cp\u003e' + userInput + '\u003c/p\u003e'\n\n    document.getElementById('input').value = ''\n  }\n})\n```\n\nThis code is giving the user the ability to send a message when they tap Enter. It also clears out the input afterwards so that the input is ready for the next message. \n\n![new code segment shown working](https://cloud-prej9qe5y-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0newcodesegment.gif)\n\n## Add ability for bot to respond\nWe're able to send a message, but we're not currently getting a response. \n\nWith the segment of code below, we're going to give the game bot the ability to respond to our message and place it onto the screen\n\n```\nmyGame.botAction('respond', 'Send a text response to the user', { message: 'What you want to say to the user' }, data =\u003e {\n  // Add the bot's response to the conversation\n  document.getElementById('conversation').innerHTML += '\u003cp\u003e' + data.message + '\u003c/p\u003e'\n})\n```\n\nNow we're able to get a response to our messages!\n\n![getting response](https://cloud-ajjskyyoq-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0getmeout.gif)\n\n## Create a variable to keep score\nTo add more complexity to our game, we can add variables. Variables can be anything from the mood of the character you're talking with to the darkness of the room you're in. \n\nIn this example below, let's implement a score into the game (although feel free to implement whatever variable you'd like)\n\n```\nmyGame.variable('score', 'Current score. Changes (positive and negatively) as the user does things.', 0)\n\nmyGame.botAction('respond', 'Send a text response to the user', { message: 'What you want to say to the user' }, data =\u003e {\ndocument.getElementById('conversation').innerHTML += '\u003cp\u003e' + data.message + '\u003c/p\u003e'\n\ndocument.getElementById('score').innerHTML = data.currentVariables.score.value\n})\n```\n\nKeep in mind that you're *adding to the bot action* instead of creating a whole new bot action.\n\n![Change my score](https://cloud-3so5m9g4f-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0changemyscore.gif)\n\n\n## Update the background with variables\nYou can also change the styles of the game using variables.\n\nFor example, you can change the background using variables. \n\n```\nmyGame.variable('scaredLevel', 'How scared the user is. This changes quickly. From 0 (not scared) to 50 (very scared).', 0)\n\nmyGame.botAction('respond', 'Send a text response to the user', { message: 'What you want to say to the user' }, data =\u003e {\n\n  document.body.style.backgroundColor = `rgba(0, 0, 0, ${data.currentVariables.scaredLevel.value / 50})`\n\n})\n```\n\n![Darken screen](https://cloud-detca5vdf-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0darkerscreen.gif)\n\n## Customize prompt to make your own game\n\nNow you can change the prompt on your first line\n\n```\nvar myGame = new WizardOrpheus('', `\nYou are an employee at the Capybara Cafe, a place rumored to use capybaras in its beverages. While the public face of the cafe is that of a charming spot offering coffee and tea, there are secrets about the ingredients used that must be kept from prying eyes, especially investigators who might disguise themselves as customers to unearth the truth.\n`)\n```\n\nAfter you change the prompt in your game logic (script.js), you can change the content of the UI by going to your index.html file, and altering the paragraph text on line 12.\n\n```\n  \u003cp\u003eYou are a private investigator working to uncover secrets of the Capybara Cafe. Figure out the secret and win the\n    game.\u003c/p\u003e\n```\n\nPlease come up with your own game! A great example is Zach's rug merchant game where you have to convince a rug merchant to sell you a rug for only $100 when the merchant wants $200.\n\nI was able to get the merchant to give it to me for free in a single message. Try to beat my high score (maybe that means them giving you money + the rug or maybe even giving you more rugs for free). \n\nHere's the link to Zach's game: [Zach's rug merchant game](https://hack.af/qv9xy)\n\nPlease share your game on the Hack Club Slack when you finish it! \n"

Make sure you at least take a look at it! It will be very helpful later!\n\n## An Introduction to Smithing: So what's CAD, and why CAD?\n\n(TLDR at the bottom because I know this is kinda long)\n\n#### What is CAD?\n\nCAD (Computer Aided Design) is the use of computers to help design (wow never would have guessed). \n\nMore specifically, it's software that replaces normal tools like pencil and paper. Instead of being forced to draw thousands of technical drawings using tools like rulers and compasses, and even then being slightly imprecise, a CAD software cuts that all out because its lines are always straight, and it can simulate things like rotations, interactions between parts, or even the physics of systems. For instance, if the design was for a house, the architect and simulate and find stress on different portions of the house, and reinforce the parts that need strength. \n\nCAD can be split into two major types: 2D CAD and 3D CAD.\n\n##### 2D CAD\n\n![A 2D CAD Floor Plan](https://cloud-b9hkk1e7s-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\n(Barki, Hichem \u0026 Fadli, Fodil \u0026 Shaat, Ahmed \u0026 Boguslawski, Pawel \u0026 Mahdjoubi, Lamine. (2015). BIM Models Generation From 2D CAD Drawings And 3D Scans: An Analysis Of Challenges And Opportunities For AEC Practitioners. 10.2495/BIM150311.)\n\n2D CAD programs usually are used for simpler things like fashion, floor plans, and application layouts. These are usually used for either very simple things or digital things that do not need to be made into 3D. It's not much different from blueprints, if they are used for 3D things. The image above is a particularly complicated floor plan, made with 2D CAD.\n\n##### 3D CAD\n\n![3D CAD Manufacturing Part](https://cloud-2ciz1c7b0-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\n(Osborne, Angela, 6-21-2022, \"Autodesk Fusion 360 Unifies Design, Manufacturing Process,\" Production Machining, https://www.productionmachining.com/products/autodesk-fusion-360-unifies-design-manufacturing-process)\n\n3D CAD, on the other hand, is used far more widely. For instance, it can be used to replace blueprints. Instead of being forced to draw blueprints of every perspective, you can just look around in the simulated world of 3D CAD. The above is an application in engineering.\n\n##### CAD in Industry\n\n![Some Industry Uses](https://cloud-2iy9idjv7-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\n(Michael Gigante, 7-15-2020, \"Computer-Aided Design (CAD): State of Category,\" G2, https://www.g2.com/articles/computer-aided-design-cad-state-of-category)\n^ Provides a lot of cool insights about uses of CAD in the Market today\n\nThese are some of CAD's applications to Industry. Learning this can open up whole new career paths to you! Even in other industries, CAD can help you visualize things.\n\n##### What will I learn?\n\nBeyond just skills with CAD design, it also provides many useful exercises to the brain. It encourages you to see many items not as base items, but as a combination (or a difference) of many different shapes. It can also help develop your visualization skills. \n\n3D CAD (think of it like a really advanced weapon blueprint planner) is what we will be using to make the swords! TinkerCAD has multiple applications, but its first (and most common) use is in 3D modeling, with basic shapes.\n\n***TL; DR***: CAD (Computer Aided Design) is using computers to help in designing things, that are either 2D (flat) like clothes or 3D (not flat) like buildings or robots. It's got a lot of uses in industry and design. In this jam, you will learn how to make simple items like swords in TinkerCAD, an online CAD software.\n\nWith that out of the way (and you hopefully more and more interested in CAD Design), let's hop in!\n\n## Enter the Virtual Forge\n\nThe best option for online CAD is TinkerCAD, a free website CAD made by Autodesk, a big CAD company.\n\n### But Before you enter...\n\nPrepare a mouse. TinkerCAD (and most other 3D Modeling programs) are **wayyyy** easier to use with a mouse, although it is still usable with a trackpad. To prove this point (and totally not because I'm too lazy to get my mouse,) I will make this tutorial example using my trackpad. \n\nPersonally, I wouldn't subject anyone to the hell of trackpad CAD, especially in more advanced programs.\n\n### Create an Account\n\nHead over to the [TinkerCAD Website](https://www.tinkercad.com/) and create an account\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"What is TinkerCAD?\"\u003e\n\nTinkerCAD is a web-based computer aided design (CAD) software, developed by Autodesk (who makes many other CAD softwares). In simple terms, TinkerCAD lets you model in your browser, and import/export models easily. It even lets you turn a model into a Minecraft or Lego build. With the ease of its use, it has become the small beginner's workshop to all the big, magnificent forges.\n\nPROS:\n\n- Web-based free software\n    \n- Very easy to learn, and for that reason is seen as the entryway to CAD\n    \n- The one of the only 3D modeling softwares that can function fine without a mouse (of course it’s still better with one)\n\nCONS:\n- Functionality is really basic. Hard to model advanced things\n\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"If you're unable to use TinkerCAD\"\u003e\n\nBlender and Fusion 360 are valid alternatives, though both are far harder to use.\n\nFusion 360 requires a pretty expensive membership. Check with your school, since some private institutions may have Autodesk access for students. It's also worth a try to register \u003ca href=\"https://www.autodesk.com/education/students\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\n\nBlender, on the other hand, is free and open source, though it does require a download. It regularly gets updates and improvements to both UI and functionality, and it's a bit easier to use than Fusion. It does offer a LOT of different functions, most of which people rarely use. You can download it \u003ca href=\"https://www.blender.org/\"\u003e here \u003c/a\u003e.\n\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"Looking for CAD communities you can join?\"\u003e\n\nI found many very interesting communities on discord. All of them are filled with CAD designers ranging in all levels of knowledge. \n\n\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/blender\"\u003e Blender Community \u003c/a\u003e\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/YcX3hUq9kv\"\u003e 3D Modeling \u003c/a\u003e\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/3dprinters\"\u003e 3D Printing \u003c/a\u003e\n\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n## Navigating Your Workshop\n\nWelcome to your TinkerCAD Dashboard! \n\n![TinkerCAD Home](https://cloud-9lm6dohxy-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nOn the left is your profile. Everything here is self explanatory, and Collections is equivalent to folders (or I guess something like an armory to store collections of items). \n\nAt the middle-top of the screen you can find many different things. From left to right, they are:\n\n- Tinker: Make a new design\n- Gallery: Browse great things others made\n- Projects: Tutorials to make projects\n- Classrooms: Set up a Google Classroom-esque system\n- Resources: Many helpful resources\n\nIf you scroll down a bit, you can find the three types of things that TinkerCAD currently allows you to make. \n\n![Scrolled Down](https://cloud-3y9wqx163-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nWe'll start with the first one, a 3D design. Create a new one, and let's hop in!\n\n## Learning the Ways of the Craft\n\n![BP](https://cloud-r7su62mp4-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nWoah...\n\nLet's break it down into different portions. \n\n### Top Left: Magical Duplication\n\nDid you expect this forge to be realistic, and accurate to the Middle Ages?\n\nNO! Like many fantasy worlds, we have ***MAGIC*** to speed up your forging process!\n\n![Magic](https://cloud-6r1vkcvp3-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nThese are your magical tools that do the basic functions for you.\n\nThe logo just teleports you back to your dashboard.\n\nThe menu button teleports your projects in front of you for quick access.\n\nThe random text is a name, which TinkerCAD will randomly generate every time. It's usually just some gibberish, and you should usually rename what the file to what this project is. Just click on it to rename.\n\n... Hey, you can rename this file later. Learn the basics first. \n\nThe little buttons are greyed out because you haven't made anything yet. From left to right, they are:\n\nCopy, Paste, Duplicate, Delete, Undo, and Redo.\n\nIf you're an experienced magic user, you can always just use the spells:\nCtrl C, Ctrl V, Ctrl D, Delete/Backspace, Ctrl Z, Ctrl Y\n\nIf you're using the spellbook Mac Book, just use Cmd instead.\n\n### Top Right: Magic Simulations\n\n![Sims](https://cloud-fknezgu6z-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nFrom left to right, they are:\n\nNormal Buildplate (where you are right now)\nPhysics Simulation (throw things at your projects and knock them around)\nMinecraft Simulation (shows you how to build items in Minecraft)\nLego Simulation (shows you how to build items in Lego)\nInvite Collaborators \n\n### Just Below That: Taking it out of the Forge\n\n![Exporting](https://cloud-iap0mf39z-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nFirst, the blue buttons below let you create workplanes, rulers, and notes. \n\nThe buttons above bring up new panels where you can import and export your models. Read the guide about filetypes at the bottom for more information about those.\n\nBelow this is the gallery of shapes, and to the right are additional tools. We will go over both of those in Part 1.\n\n### The Workplane: Your Anvil\n\n![Workplane](https://cloud-1a8ccnyrn-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nFinally we get to the biggest thing on the screen. This is where all of your items are going to go. \n\nThe top cube thing is the viewing cube. Drag that around or use right click drag to change the angle at which you view your weapon. Next, from top to bottom is Home, Full screen, Zoom in, Zoom out, View change.\n\n\nAnd with that we are done! Worried you will forget something? Just hover over anything to read the tooltip!\n\n\n## The World of Magic\n\nDid you think moving your cursor all the way to a button to click it took way too long? Don't worry! The person who made your forge (TinkerCAD's developers) left you a handy list of all the spells (shortcuts) that people use!\n\n![TinkerCAD Shortcuts](https://blogdottinkercaddotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/tinkercadkeyboardshortcuts.png?w=1060)\n\n(Team Tinkercad, 06-25-2019, \"Keyboard Shortcuts for the 3D Editor,\" https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/keyboard-shortcuts-for-the-3d-editor)\n\nThis should also be in your Handouts page!\n\n## Forging by Parts:\n\nTinkerCAD's assistants already made the base materials for our sword, so that you (the master blacksmith) won't need to concern yourself with the basics.\n\nRemember the shapes panel to the very right? Now we are going to introduce that. \n\n![Sidebar](https://cloud-guk4phez0-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nThis side panel shows you all the shapes for your project. These basic shapes let you create the basic parts of your model from common polyhedrons, and there are many shapes that others have made already, which you can find by expanding the drop-down bar and clicking on another collection.\n\nAlright, now let's place a cube into the workspace. Drag the red cube onto the workplane (or just click twice). A small menu should pop up: \n\n![ObjMenu](https://cloud-uelpmjkk4-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nThese are the shape's **Attributes**. Each shape has its own unique attributes, but generally all shapes have at least one. \n\nFor a cube, the first one indicates the radius of the circle if you wished to round it. The second one is largely specific to round shapes, and just indicates how smooth you want it to be, with more steps being more smooth, while the last 3 are self-explanatory.\n\nIf you are ever confused about attributes, just experiment with it!\n\nWe will address what Solid and Hole means in part 2! We will explore that in part 2!\n\n## The Body of the Blade\n\nAs a 3D Modeler (or Blacksmith, however you prefer to call yourself), you need to practice the skill of generalizing an object into its basic, regular polyhedron pieces. Or in other words, you have to break an object up into its basic shapes (if you are an artist, it's like breaking an animal's leg into quadrilaterals for easier drawing).\n\n![bird](https://cloud-lo854k5el-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\n(Administrator, 12-6-2020, \"Week Starting 7th December,\" Space Aylesbury, https://www.spaceaylesbury.org/week-starting-7th-december-breaking-down-a-drawing-into-shapes-part-1/)\n\nWe will practice this on the blade. Let's look at how a sword's blade usually looks (along with my terrible drawing).\n\n![Sword Breakdown](https://cloud-2a8js3e0d-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-08-03_at_1.54.34_pm.png)\n\n(Militarysurplusworld.Com Based On Idosell, n.d., \"Ferrum sword -Magnum,\" militarysurplusworld, https://www.militarysurplusworld.com/product-eng-43263-Ferrum-sword-Magnum.html)\n\nLooks like a long, almost rectangular shape, with a triangle attached to the end. \n\nAnd let's also look at the cross-section. \n\n![Blade Cross Sections](https://cloud-ffm4mev78-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\n(Starr Z. Davies, n.d., \"Wednesday Warriors,\" https://starrzdavies.com/wednesday-warriors-3-basic-blade-cross-sections-and-their-purpose/)\n\nLet's just use a simple diamond shape right now. It looks like, well, a diamond. \n\nSo (QUIZ TIME!!!) what kind of 3D shape do we need for the long, straight part of the blade? (Also, it's really hard to describe what I'm talking about. Let's just call the long, straight part of the blade the \"stem\" for now.)\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"QUIZ QUESTION 1\"\u003e\n\nWe need a Rhombus/Diamond prism shape! 10 (virtual) blacksmith points if you were right!\n\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\nGreat! That about the top, pointy part?\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"QUIZ QUESTION 2\"\u003e\n\nWe need a Rhombus/Diamond pyramid shape! 10 more (virtual) blacksmith points if you were right!\n\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\nNow that we have that, all we need is to actually make it.\n\n## Forging the Blade (but actually this time)\n\n**If at any point in this section you get confused, there are demo videos in the slides up top!**\n\nNow we will make the bone of your sword.\n\nYou may have realized that, although we figured out we needed a rhombus, TinkerCAD doesn't actually have rhombus as a base shape. How do we make it then? \n\nLet me tell you the ways of the 3D Modeling Blacksmith. There's 3 ways to make any shape:\n\n- Combine a few shapes (Addition)\n- Subtract shapes from each other (Subtraction)\n- Deform another shape to make what you want (Modification)\n\nLet's take a look at the sidebar again, and cross out everything that doesn't look even remotely workable. We need sharp edges, right? We can cross out all the rounded shapes.\n\n![Crossed out bad options](https://cloud-d7x8mzz7m-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nLet's go through our options and try each one. First is addition. We know that we want a rhombus shape, and a rhombus is basically just two triangles. The green triangular prism seems up to the job. Let's drag it onto the workplane.\n\nOh right, let me tell you the basic controls. Click to select, Hold right click and drag to change perspective, and scroll to zoom. Press shift while dragging with right click to slide your perspective. If you want to return to a cardinal direction, just click a face, edge, or vertex of the little cube at the top left.\n\n![Selecting a Shape](https://cloud-ekuqoiqkx-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nThe blue highlight shows what you are clicking, the white squares at the bottom allow you to modify the length and width when you drag it, and the black dots only change one dimension if you want to (for instance) lock the width and only modify the length. The top white dot also lets you only modify the height.\n\nYou can drag a shape to move it around, drag the top black arrow to move it up, and press the key \"d\" to drop any floating shape down (or up) to the workplane.\n\nThe three arrow things indicate rotations. We will be using that now.\n\nWe want to rotate this so it stands upright. Click and hole on the little rotation button you see on the top right (you may want to change perspectives, since if you are just looking at the front you won't see it)\n\n![Rotation Ring](https://cloud-kyclafb1o-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nNow a ring will pop up. Drag it around the ring, but hold it over the bigger inside ticks instead of the smaller outside ticks. Doing this makes your shape snap to 45 degree increments instead of making it less precise.\n\n![Rotated](https://cloud-7m6d0lwtj-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nGreat! It's upright! We'll need another prism, so just go ahead and make another one, but rotate it the other way. You can also drag the shape to move it around\n\nNow let's align and merge.\n\n![Two aligned](https://cloud-68ym5um4a-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nMove it until it's roughly touching. The line between them will be very thin.\n\n![Two Touching](https://cloud-k5j0yfozs-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nNext, hold shift and select both shapes. Look to the top right, the group symbol should light up.\n\n![Group Button](https://cloud-fb1jdb1yr-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\n![Selected](https://cloud-q9pyttv6b-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nClick it and after a while, the line between should dissapear. You've grouped a shape! \n\n![Merged](https://cloud-7o9iz07ko-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nNow just stretch it a bit with the little black dot at the bottom.\n\n![Selected Bottom Dot](https://cloud-1zlkxugpq-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nThe number indicates now long in millimeters it is. Click and type into it to indicate a length if you would like, or just drag the black dot that should have just turned red. \n\n![Stretched](https://cloud-adhbzxjbq-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nGreat! That's one way of forging the stem. The other way, using the modification technique, will be left as an exercise to the reader (always wanted to say that)\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"Hint\"\u003e\n\nIt uses the red cube!\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"Hint 2\"\u003e\n\nWhat if we rotated it 45 degrees?\n\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\nNow, just drag the top white dot upwards, and you now have a long blade! For now though, since we need a tip, let's keep it the same length.\n\n## Sharpening the Tip\n\nRemember the dimensions of the bottom? Just click on a white dot to check.\n\n![Check Dimensions](https://cloud-ozsdfln1l-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\n20 mm by 50 mm. Let's now make the tip. Let's also go a bit faster now that you've learn the basics. \n\nDrag a yellow pyramid onto the plane, and rotate it 45 degrees to align with the blade. \n\nEdit its dimensions to match with the base. \n\n![Sword Tip](https://cloud-22l1svwby-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nLet's use a neat little tool called align. select both shapes with shift, now click this new button on the top right.\n\n![Align Button](https://cloud-22l1svwby-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1image.png)\n\nBlack dots should pop up. Each one aligns the shapes in a different dimension. We are interested in the ones in the middle of the base. \n\n![Align Dots](https://cloud-m5wixe5jx-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nYou should get this. \n\n![Inside](https://cloud-m5wixe5jx-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1image.png)\n\nPress \"d\" to situate it on the workplane, and drag the pyramid up using the arrow until it aligns with the base, much like we did earlier with the two green triangles.\n\n![Aligned Vertically](https://cloud-m5wixe5jx-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/2image.png)\n\nGroup them together, and you have a short blade!\n\n![Short Blade](https://cloud-m5wixe5jx-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/3image.png)\n\nDon't worry if it changed entirely to yellow or green, TinkerCAD assigns colors based on its parts to the grouped whole. just click on it, and then this in the sidebar to change color if you would like. \n\n![Item Color](https://cloud-m5wixe5jx-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/4image.png)\n\nTo lengthen the blade, let's drag the top white dot upwards, but not before zooming out first so we have more space. \n\n![Top Dot Drag](https://cloud-m5wixe5jx-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/5image.png)\n\nFeel free to click this button and ungroup to resize the stem and tip individually. \n\n![Ungroup](https://cloud-m5wixe5jx-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/6image.png)\n\nGreat! You now have a blade of the legends!!!\n\n![End Blade](https://cloud-m5wixe5jx-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/7image.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n## (Optional) A Guide to the Elements\n\n**You should read this section if you have a 3D Printer, or if you plan to bring your creation to the real world in some way!**\n\nThere are many different elements (or as most people call it, filetypes) you can use to create your projects.\n\n### 3D Filetypes\n\n**.obj** files are supported by a lot of 3D printers and programs. In addition to shape, it stores color, texture, and material information. The downside is that obj files do not track the size, making precise projects hard.\n\n**.stl** files are the most common types used for 3D programs. Most 3D printers also support it. Generally, default to using this file. However, it still does not track size.\n\nAlthough TinkerCAD does not export into **.3mf** files, it's also very common and is arguably the best filetype. The reason is simple: it tracks size. \n\n### 2D Filetypes\n\n**.svg** files store a 2D pattern as vectors, which tells machines like computers how to render it, and machines like Laser Cutters and CNC machines how to cut it from wood or metal.\n\n\n\n## Summary and Next Up:\n\nThanks for choosing this Jam and for choosing the wonderful world of 3D modeling! With these skills, you can soon interact with your software in the real world!\n\nToday, you learned how to Navigate TinkerCAD, Use its tools, and Think like a CAD designer!\n\nOn the next episode/step we will finish the sword by creating the hilt!\n\nSee you next time!\n"

It's always possible to make more decorations!)*\n\nAfter you have already learned the ways to use TinkerCAD from the last part, this is just going to move much faster and utilize the things you know.\n\nAnd for ease of communication, from now on I will just call the longer non-height measurement of whatever shape as the length, and the shorter non-height measurement as the width. \n\nI'm also going to stop giving you rigid length measurements, to force you to be creative and find lengths and proportions you like.\n\nRemember to use the handout from last time!\n\n##  **Outline:**\n\n1. **Deconstructing the Hilt** *(planning how to model the hilt)*\n2. **Fusing the Pieces** *(finally putting everything together)*\n3. **Armory of Legends** *(sharing your sword with your peers!)*\n\n## Deconstructing the Hilt\n\nLet's do a similar process with \n\n![Wikipedia Image of Sword Parts](https://cloud-jtvxpzl1c-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/2image.png)\n\nWhen you are modeling (like when you are programming), it's always helpful to break big items into smaller parts. Modeling individual pieces and grouping them together is always easier than trying to do the whole thing. \n\nAs such, let's break the hilt itself into the three key parts: the cross-guard, grip, and pommel.\n\nAgain, we have videos in the slides up top to guide you if you want to see how to make a basic hilt. But don't stick to the tutorial! We encourage putting as much creativity as you can muster into this project!\n\nHere's some good resources to look at various hilts and gain inspiration!\nhttp://myarmoury.com/feature_hilts.html \nhttps://swordencyclopedia.com/sword-hilt/\nhttps://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search?showOnly=highlights\u0026sortOrder=asc\u0026sortBy=Relevance\u0026department=4\u0026material=Arms\n\n### Cross Guard\n\nLet's take a look at a real one\n\n![Cross Guard Sample Image](https://swordencyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Crossguard-Sword-Title.jpg)\n\n(David Mickov, 6-7-2023, \"The Different Crossguard Sword Types and Styles From Europe • Sword Encyclopedia,\" Sword Encyclopedia, https://swordencyclopedia.com/crossguard-sword/)\n\nIt looks already quite simple, but we can make it simpler. It's basically the same as the blade (a diamond prism shape) but stretched way wider and being shorter.\n\n![Hilt Base](https://cloud-lpi8legia-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nIf you wanted a straight handguard, we are done. But we can do better than that. \n\nA problem with TinkerCAD is that it's hard to curve objects that aren't already curved. However, remember that we have a lot of shapes that we can work with, and remember the three key ways we can make a weird shape:\n\n- Combine a few shapes (Addition)\n- Subtract shapes from each other (Subtraction)\n- Deform another shape to make what you want (Modification)\n\nIn this case, let's try subtraction since it's hard to add a curve or do anything with deforming shapes in TinkerCAD. \n\nLet's grab a cylinder and rotate it 90 degrees. Stretch it out lengthwise and decrease its height to make its curve more gradual. \n\n![Cylinder Modifying](https://cloud-lpi8legia-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1image.png)\n\nLet's duplicate it (either by using Ctrl C and Ctrl V, or just Ctrl D). Move it so that they are barely touching, and use our old friend the align tool to, well, align them. \n\n![Align](https://cloud-lpi8legia-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/2image.png)\n\nNotice how I will only click the red dot (align width-wise) and not the middle dot on the long side, since that will just make them overlap. We get this:\n\n![Cyl2](https://cloud-lpi8legia-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/3image.png)\n\nGroup them, and align them with the red hilt body. You can make a few adjustments to the height and length of the cylinder abomination, and make sure to move it up a bit since we want to cut the top, not the bottom of the red shape.\n\n![Example](https://cloud-lpi8legia-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/4image.png)\n\nNow we address what you see here: Holes. \n\n![Holes](https://cloud-lpi8legia-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/5image.png)\n\nYou're probably wondering how we can do subtraction, if so far all I showed you is combining two shapes into one. To that I say, we use **holes**. \n\nGrouping a hole with a solid cuts holes in it. Let's make the orange shape a hole, and then use the group tool on it and the red shape. \n\nBefore the grouping:\n![pregroup](https://cloud-lpi8legia-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/6image.png)\n\nAfter the grouping:\n![postgroup](https://cloud-lpi8legia-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/7image.png)\n\nA small tip with holes: remember that you can use an object you've already cut shapes out of as another hole! \n\n\n\n#### Optional Challenge with this tip in mind\n\nWith this technique I made the bottom curve as well. Try to figure out how I did that as a challenge, or simply move on if you'd like. \n\n![chal](https://cloud-lpi8legia-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/8image.png)\n\nGreat! You've made it past the most difficult part! You can stay here to decorate more, but for our purposes (whether you did the challenge or not) this hilt is more than enough. Now let's move on. \n\n### Grip\n\nThis is much easier. All we need is a cylinder that shrinks as you get higher. If you want to be technical about it, this is called a frustum, or in our case a cone frustum.\n\n... Oh wait that isn't a pre-made shape? Let's make it then!\n\nIf you search up frustum you will probably see diagrams like this:\n\n![Cone Frustum](https://cloud-fb5vv4641-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nHey, isn't that just a cone but with the tip cut out? We can do that with holes!\n\nSince you already know how to use holes (and are probably tired with my rambling), I'm not going to elaborate much. I'll just show pictures.\n\n![frust1](https://cloud-fb5vv4641-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1image.png)\n\n![f2](https://cloud-fb5vv4641-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/2image.png)\n\nEasy right? Shapes like this gets easier and easier to identify as you model more and more.\n\n### Pommel\n\nThe pommel is probably the most flexible bit of the sword. As such, I highly suggest you come up with your original idea.\n\nI'm just going to show some pictures of me making an easy cylinder pommel if you run out of cool ideas. \n\nThis simple cylinder pommel is just making each part separately, aligning and fusing. The tutorial video in the slides gives an even easier example that doesn't even include the center sphere.\n\n![c1](https://cloud-cof3vpycd-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\n![c2](https://cloud-cof3vpycd-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1image.png)\n\n![c3](https://cloud-cof3vpycd-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/2image.png)\n\n\n## Fusing the Pieces\n\nLet's look at our inventory.\n\n![Inventory](https://cloud-bl0ftjpng-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\n(I just made all of them a bit smaller because TinkerCAD was yelling at me about a size limit... oops)\n\nA video of the fusing process is within the slides again, but this is basically just repeating what you did countless times before in order to put pieces together.\n\nAfter some resizing and combination, we are (FINALLY) done!\n\n![End product](https://cloud-bl0ftjpng-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1image.png)\n\n(You can recolor parts by ungrouping it, then recoloring each piece by selecting it, clicking the \"solid\" button, and pressing a different color.)\n\nFit for a king!\n\n## Armory of Legends\n\nNow, let's go ahead and show your swords to your peers! \n\nMarvel at the creativity and skills of both yourself and those around you!\n\nYou can even think of unique powers for your swords, and write them into Dungeons and Dragons magic items!\n\nHere's a cool website for that: \u003ca href=\"https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/\"\u003e https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/ \u003c/a\u003e\n\n## Next steps???\n\nIf you want to move on with more modeling, there are many different ways to move forward!\n\nFirst, I would recommend the \"Build your own 3D club village\" Jam by linkai101! It involves the use of Spline, a slightly more advanced web-based system. \n\nIt is here: \u003ca href=\"https://code-jams.hackclub.dev/jam/3d-club-village\"\u003e https://code-jams.hackclub.dev/jam/3d-club-village \u003c/a\u003e.\n\n### Other Programs\n\nOne of the most common applications used by casual modelers is Blender, a free open-sourced modeling application. It requires downloading, though. Its devs are very good, and it regularly receives updates to introduce more functionality or make your experience better. \n\nIt's website is \u003ca href=\"https://www.blender.org/\"\u003e blender.org \u003c/a\u003e. \n\nPROS:\n1. Really good for visual things (when you want something to look cool but don’t need it to work well as a piece of something)\n2. Functionality (has everything needed and can edit shapes in ways that other software cannot)\n3. Lots of tutorials (and a great documentation) online to follow if you are stuck\n4. Always Free\n\nCONS:\n1. Cannot model parts if you are asking for precise measurement\n2. Takes a while to get used to all of its functionality\n3. Needs a download\n\nProfessional and industry modelers commonly use AutoDesk's Fusion 360, a paid modeling application that's really advanced and involves multiple simulation types. It also requires downloading, and normally costs quite a lot. However, some schools that partner with AutoDesk may have those for free! Check with whoever manages tech at your school to see if you can access Fusion for free!\n\nIt's website is \u003ca href=\"https://www.autodesk.com/campaigns/education/fusion-360\"\u003e here \u003c/a\u003e. \n\nPROS:\n1. Really good for precise measurement parts\n2. Easy to learn, 99% of the time you’re using 2 functions\n3. Professional level, good for college applications or resume\n4. Lots of ways to assemble parts together within the application before you print\n\nCONS:\n1. Hard to model things that look good on the level of Blender\n2. Hard to find tutorials that address the specific issue you have\n3. Hard to start learning (but gets easier once you get the basics)\n4. Only free for students, will not be free if you continue it after you graduate\n\nOverall, AutoDesk has a lot of really good CAD applications, but most of them cost money unless you have a school subscription.\n\n### A Word of Thanks!\n\nThanks again for choosing this Jam and for choosing the wonderful world of 3D modeling! \n\nToday, you built on your past skills and learned how to create the rest of the sword!\n\nNext, you can try more complicated software, like Blender or Fusion 360.\n\nNow go and make your dreams come true! Happy Crafting!!\n"

And what can you do with them?\n\n\u003cvideo src=\"https://cloud-ckyxamknp-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0jams_gifs__1_.mp4\" controls=\"controls\" style={{maxWidth: \"720px\"}}\u003e\u003c/video\u003e\n*(here's an example of what you'll create by the end of this jams. Your AI \u0026 ML model will be unique to you and serve a completely different purpose!)*\n\n**We're going to be making an AI Companion or Smart Voice Assistant in your browser!**\n\nMy companion is going to be Orpheus! [You may have heard of her.](https://workshops.hackclub.com/orpheus/) Believe it or not you will be able to create this project by the end of this jams no matter how much background knowledge you have already! And your project will be entirely yours (take advantage of that creative freedom)!\n\nHere are some ideas for your AI Companion:\n- create an AI smart assistant that will constantly disagree with you and critique you\n- create an AI relationship if you're quite lonely\n- create an AI project manager that helps you schedule your day\n- create an AI friend who you can have dinner with (again, if you're quite lonely)\n- create an AI cooking companion who will walk you through steps while you're in the kitchen\n- create an AI pet\n- create an AI teacher who will give you lectures\n\nThis AI project will be completely web-based using HTML, JS, and CSS as well as tools such as Teachable Machine by Google and Replit. We'll also go over step-by-step instructions on how to incorporate OpenAI API into our project!\n\n**In this part, we'll start with an introduction into machine learning as well as our Teachable Machine model! By the end of today, you'll have made and trained your own ML model to recognize an audio or visual keyword.**\n\n[Live Demo ](https://ai-jams-official.sahitid.repl.co) **(Make sure to input your own API Key if you want it to work!)**\n[Sample Code](https://replit.com/@sahitid/AI-Jams-Official)**(Make sure to input your own API Key if you want it to work!)**\n[Sample Teachable Model](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/models/hiSl8IOc-/)\n\n### **Outline:**\n1. **Overview of Project** *(bird's eye view on the entire project)*\n2. **Get Started with Teachable Machine** *(train your own machine learning tool in your browser)*\n3. **Create Your Classes** *(decide what activates your AI companion)*\n4. **Train Your Model** *(add/create training data for your teachable machine*\n5. **Finish and Export!**\n6. **Enter The Code Editor** *(start coding in your browser)*\n7. **Onto the JS!**\n8. **Add Some Boilerplate HTML**\n\n## Overview of Project\n\nYou may be familiar already with smart voice assistants such as Siri, Alexa, or Google Home. All these technologies utilize artificial intelligence to generate and complete messages.\n\nYou will be building a similar program. Call it, and it will turn on. It will turn your speech into text, and then input your transcript into a GPT model (through an API). The GPT model will then create a response which is turned into speech. The program will essentially talk back to you.\n\n![diagram detailing the parts of our project](https://cloud-essfp77oh-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0group_1.png)\n\nIn this part, we'll be training the model to detect when the keyword is evoked with Teachable Machine.\n\n## Get Started with Teachable Machine!\n\nWe're going to be starting with teachable machine, a web-based tool that allows you to train your own machine learning model without any coding required.\n\nWe want to make sure that our AI Companion can recognize an audio or visual keyword! Just like a smart voice assistant:\n\n![](https://cloud-iosp3gjlp-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nHead over to [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train) and create a new project. I'm going to be creating an audio project! Keep in mind that you can use any of the three projects; your keyword could be a key-hand-motion or key-object that is held in front of the camera.\n\nAnything that is obvious enough to be detected in order to prompt the AI Companion will work here!\n\n![teachable machine dashboard](https://cloud-cffjo14g3-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-06-27_154600.png)\n\nOnce you choose your project from the dashboard, you should see the different classes. Let's focus on what we want to train the model to learn/look out for first.\n\n## Create Your Classes\n\nI want my AI Orpheus to respond to me whenever I say \"Orpheus\". Rename Class 2 to match your keyword, and don't copy mine! Your AI Companion should be completely your own.\n\n![renaming teachable machine classes](https://cloud-jefx2fwob-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0teachable.gif)\n\nIt's almost as if you have two piles of stickers. Think of each sticker as a sample of training data.\n\nYou can add existing stickers (or samples) to the piles (or classes) to make it more clear what the characteristics of each class are.\n\n![two piles of stickers](https://cloud-7cg6bj1c5-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0img_8125.jpg)\n\nThen the machine learning model can take and entirely new sample that you give it as input and use the data in the existing classes to sort it.\n\n![sorting stickers into respective piles based on existing data](https://cloud-jjpf3syuu-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0jams_gifs__1_.gif)\n\n## Train Your Model\n\nNow it's time to train! If you're doing an image or pose model click on \"Webcam\" and then hold to take a burst of photos. If you're doing an audio project, click the \"Mic\" button to record short clips of your keyword being said.\n\n*Tip: the best training data set has multiple variations of the same sample in different settings.*\n\nThe minimum number of samples based on the project type is listed. But remember more data = better accuracy of model.\n\nIf I had even more stickers in the piles it would be even easier to sort new stickers that I got because there would be more data to evaluate from! \n\n### Now record and extract sample data\n\nAlso make sure to record lots of silence and background noise as well in different settings (in a classroom, hallway, outside, alone, etc) so the model is good at detecting when nothing is being said. We want there to be a clear distinction between when the keyword is said vs. when it is not said.\n\n![adding audio samples to teachable machine classes](https://cloud-lmzin6jbg-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0website_gifs.gif)\n\n## Finish and Export\n\nAnd tada! Once you're done click the \"Train Model\" button. Now you have a fully working machine learning model.\n\nAnd you don't have to stop there: try creating another class that'll make it easier to differentiate what is or isn't the keyword even further. \n\nFor example, I know the word \"amorphous\" sort of sounds like Orpheus, but isn't exactly the keyword. Currently, the model still gets a little confused and assumes that someone saying \"amorphous\" is partially saying Orpheus.\n\n![false keyword detected](https://cloud-3kt0jz704-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-06-28_105128.png)\n\nI'm going to make a separate class for the word \"amorphous\" so it no longer confuses the model.\n\nBack to our sticker and basket analogy, this is just me creating another basket so people aren't confused on where to put stickers when sorting them.\n\n![sorting sticker into wrong pile](https://cloud-b0mbeaace-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0ad30c6eb-346a-4ba3-aa9e-954783f524a9_1.gif)\n\nLook at the image below. Now the model is less confused when I say the similar-sounding-but-not-actually-the-keyword word.\n\n![teachable machine recognizes false keyword](https://cloud-hvxyjcxd6-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-06-28_105711.png)\n\nYou've essentially created another pile!\n\n![sorting sticker into correct pile](https://cloud-mjrezffaw-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0975da332-06c1-4bf0-95d7-e35546326741.gif)\n\n### Click the Export Model Button\n\nOnce you're here you should see an \"Update my cloud model\" button. Make sure you do this!\n\n![update my cloud model button](https://cloud-crblb6kcm-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-06-28_142611.png)\n\nNow you can show off your work by sending people the shareable link.\n\nTo finish our model we'll **copy the shareable link as well as the tensorflow.js JavaScript** that's given below.\n\nMake sure to save your teachable machine to drive so it can be accessed later. Next time, instead of creating a new project, you can open this existing project from drive.\n\n![saving project to drive](https://cloud-iibkonedk-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nGreat! Now you've finished with the teachable machine. You've trained a machine learning model with a dataset to understand and recognize when it's being called to \"turn on\".\n\nNow let's implement the model into a program so you can interact with it.\n\n## Enter the Code Editor\n\nFirstly, let's get setup in the code editor! Head over to the [Replit Website](https://replit.com/languages/html) and create an account.\n\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"What is Replit?\"\u003e\nReplit is a web-based independent development environment (IDE). It's essentially a code editor in your browser that will instantly deploy your site to the entire world\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\nIf you're having difficulty using the site try https://firewalledreplit.com/ or even an alternative like [Glitch](https://glitch.com/)\n\n### Create a New Replit Project\n\nWelcome to your Replit Dashboard. Once inside, tap \"+ Creat a Repl\" and then select the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript template.  \n\n![Replit Signup](https://cloud-c6z75ah46-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0export_jun_15_2023_0159_pm.gif)\n\nYou should now have three files. Rename them to be: index.html, script.js, and style.css respectively.\n\n## Onto the JS!\n\nLet's skip the HTML/CSS for now. We'll head straight over to `script.js` or the JavaScript file and add this initial code:\n\n``` js\nconst URL = 'INSERT TEACHABLE MACHINE URL HERE'\nconst THRESHOLD = 0.9\n```\n\nYay! We've just created the following two constants:\n1. `URL` represents the URL of the Teachable Machine model we will be using\n2. `THRESHOLD` represents the confidence threshold for recognizing a specific word\n\n![teachable machine output](https://cloud-f437a9orj-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n*(Feel free to set the threshold number to any amount you like! I've got it set for 90% or higher accuracy in recognition. This is essentially that output bar you see moving in the teachable machine).*\n\nNow we are going to create one big function that all the other functions + our teachable machine code will sit inside. It's an event handler that runs once the window is finished loading to ensure that the code inside only runs after all the HTML content has been loaded:\n```js\nwindow.onload = () =\u003e {\n  let recognizer;\n}\n```\n\n**This is where we will add pieces of the Tensorflow.js file that we got after exporting the teachable machine model.**\n\nWe should also go ahead and declare the recognizer variable (this pops up later).\n\n```js\nlet recognizer;\n```\n\nNow we're going to create a `createModel()` function that's responsible for loading the Teachable Machine model. It creates a new instance of the `speechCommands` object and uses the provided `URL` to set the model topology and metadata URLs. It then calls the `ensureModelLoaded()` function to ensure that the model and metadata are loaded via HTTPS requests.\n\n```js\nasync function createModel() {\n  const checkpointURL = URL + 'model.json'\n  const metadataURL = URL + 'metadata.json'\n\n  const recognizer = speechCommands.create(\n    'BROWSER_FFT',\n    undefined,\n    checkpointURL,\n    metadataURL\n  )\n\n  await recognizer.ensureModelLoaded()\n  return recognizer\n}\n```\n\n*Tip: If you're ever stuck or confused ~~or have a spelling mistake in your code that your IDE isn't catching but continues to break the whole program~~, try asking [AI such as ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) to figure it out for you!*\n\nAnd next, we can create the `init()` function for initializing the speech recognition process. It awaits the `createModel()` function to load the model and assigns it to the `recognizer` variable. Then, it calls the `listen()` function on the `recognizer` object.\n\n```js\nasync function init() {\n  recognizer = await createModel()\n}\n```\n\nThe `listen()` function will reside in the `init()` function and takes two arguments. The first argument is a callback function that is invoked when a word is recognized. In this case, it checks the score of the recognized word at index 1 (index 1 corresponds to the trigger word in the Teachable Machine model) and compares it with the `THRESHOLD` value. If the score is higher than the threshold, it logs \"Hey\" to the console.\n\nThe second argument is a configuration object that allows you to customize the behavior of the speech recognition. It includes options such as\n\n- `includeSpectrogram`: determines whether the `listen()` function should return the spectrogram (a visual representation of the frequencies present in an audio signal over time) data along with the recognition result.\n- `probabilityThreshold`: the accuracy threshold or minimum confidence score that a recognized word must have to be considered a valid recognition. You can adjust this value to have a higher threshold (stricter recognition) or a lower threshold (more lenient) based on your requirements.\n- `invokeCallbackOnNoiseAndUnknown`: determines whether the callback function should be invoked when the recognized word is considered noise or unknown. When set to `true`, the callback function will be triggered even when the recognized word is not part of the trained vocabulary or if it is classified as noise.\n- `overlapFactor`: value between 0 (no overlap) and 1 (complete overlap) that controls the amount of overlap between consecutive analysis frames during the recognition process. Higher overlap values can provide better accuracy but might introduce a slight delay in processing.\n\n```js\nasync function init() {\nrecognizer = await createModel()\n\nrecognizer.listen(\n    result =\u003e {\n      const orpheusNoise = result.scores[1]\n      if (orpheusNoise \u003e THRESHOLD) {\n        console.log(\"Hey\")\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      includeSpectrogram: true,\n      probabilityThreshold: 0.75,\n      invokeCallbackOnNoiseAndUnknown: true,\n      overlapFactor: 0.5\n    }\n)}\n```\n*(These are just what I put as the options, but feel free to mess around with them! I also suggest that you keep the `overlapFactor` between 0.5 and 0.75 for best accuracy \u0026 speed!)*\n\nNote that the code inside the `init()` function is not executed immediately but is defined to be executed later when the window finishes loading.\n\nFull code:\n```js\nconst URL = 'INSERT TEACHABLE MACHINE URL HERE'\nconst THRESHOLD = 0.9\n\nwindow.onload = () =\u003e {\n  //copy and paste our Teachable Machine model here!\n  let recognizer;\n\n  async function createModel() {\n    const checkpointURL = URL + 'model.json'\n    const metadataURL = URL + 'metadata.json'\n    \n    const recognizer = speechCommands.create(\n      'BROWSER_FFT',\n      undefined,\n      checkpointURL,\n      metadataURL\n    )\n\n    await recognizer.ensureModelLoaded()\n\n    return recognizer\n  }\n  \n  async function init() {\n    recognizer = await createModel()\n\n    recognizer.listen(\n      result =\u003e {\n        const orpheusNoise = result.scores[1]\n        if (orpheusNoise \u003e THRESHOLD) {\n          console.log(\"Hey\")\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        includeSpectrogram: true,\n        probabilityThreshold: 0.75,\n        invokeCallbackOnNoiseAndUnknown: true,\n        overlapFactor: 0.5\n      }\n    )\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTake a minute and look back at the Tensorflow.js code that you had the option of copying a few steps ago when you exported the Teachable machine. Can you tell where each function that you wrote ✨*all by yourself*✨ came from?\n\n*All this code above has come directly from the teachable machine Tensorflow.js file!*\n\n## Add Some Boilerplate HTML\n\nOpen the index.html file! Replit will give you some template code already, but replace that with *my* template code ~~because it's better~~.\n\n```html\n\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\n  \u003chead\u003e\n    \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\" /\u003e\n    \u003cmeta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" /\u003e\n    \u003cmeta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"ie=edge\" /\u003e\n    \u003ctitle\u003eOrpheus\u003c/title\u003e\n    \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/styles.css\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/head\u003e\n  \u003cbody\u003e\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      \u003cdiv\u003e\n        \u003cscript src=\"/script.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n\n```\n\nYou should notice that everything here is about standard, and that the three files (HTML, JS, and CSS) are now connected to each other.\n\nBut there's one last step we need to complete in order to incorporate the Teachable Machine model. Add the following code to the `\u003chead\u003e`:\n\n```html\n\u003cscript src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs@1.3.1/dist/tf.min.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n\u003cscript src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow-models/speech-commands@0.5.4/dist/speech-commands.min.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n```\n\n## Great! Now Run Your Program\n\nNow on Replit open up your HTML \"site\" in a new tab. don't worry if it's blank! It's supposed to be since we don't have many elements on it. \n\nNow click ctrl+shift+i to open the inspect element and move to the console tab. If you look under choices you'll be able to see the text that has come back!\n\n![console printing response to keyword being said](https://cloud-2sz1omo3w-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nYay! Now watch the console print \"Hey\" every time you say the keyword!\n\n## Additional Challenge Hacking! (recommended)\n\nThe creation doesn't have to stop here! Here are some Jam Hacks™ that you can experiment with:\n![jam hacks](https://cloud-f7mhrygov-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0jam_hacks_2.gif)\n\n- I've made the keyword an audio one but what if we tried using a visual/image model instead? *(My friend Thomas is testing to see what would happen if the teachable machine was trained to notice if you raised your hand or waved a flag!*)\n- What would happen if you added multiple keywords?\n- Try someone else's teachable machine model! Do you think you could confuse it.\n- I know I said I'd recommend the `overlapFactor` between 0.5 and 0.75 for best accuracy \u0026 speed, but in what scenario would having a slower and more accurate model be more appropriate? And vice versa\n\nAnd again, the best model is one that is trained with a lot of data! Always use diverse variations.\n\n## Stay Tuned To Build Your Very Own Smart Voice Assistant\n\nOkay, now that we've spent time to train our model to recognize *when* to listen let's implement it into a program that controls *how* it listens and *what* it will do with that information.\n\nAlso, printing in the console is boring, let's make it talk back to us out loud!\n\nIn the next part we will build the foundation of our AI companion by implementing a speech to text recognition API.\n"

I'm so glad you're continuing this adventure to build your own AI Companion!\n\nAlthough this Jams goes over the fundamentals of using AI and ML, reign all your creative freedom to create a fully functioning smart assistant. I'm making an [Orpheus](https://workshops.hackclub.com/orpheus/) that'll embody Hack Club's mascot but you certainly don't have to.\n\nIn fact I encourage that you go out of your way to think of the most bizarre uses of your program. Take a look at what an AI came up with as ideas.\n\n![chatgpt response with ideas for projects](https://cloud-jmwnkv7lq-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nIn this part, we'll start coding our web app with JavaScript and HTML to set up our speech to text feature, start listening function, and stop listening function!\n\n### **Outline:**\n1. **Enter The Code Editor** *(start coding in your browser)*\n2. **Set Up the HTML Some More** *(visualize the conversation with AI)*\n3. **Let's Get Orpheus to Speak!** *(text to speech recognition!)*\n\n## Enter the Code Editor\n\nFirstly, let's get setup in the code editor! Head over to the [Replit Website](https://replit.com/languages/html) and open the project you were working in the last part of this Jams.\n\nYou should see your 3 files: index.html, script.js, and style.css respectively.\n\n## Set Up the HTML Some More\n\nNow let's get Orpheus to speak instead of a boring `console.log`.\n\nThere are two parts to this: 1) we want to hear it, but 2) we also want to see it, so we need to edit the HTML now.\n\nThat's easy! Go to `index.html` and add this to the `\u003cbody\u003e`\n\n```html\n\u003cbody\u003e\n    \u003cdiv id=\"startup\"\u003e\u0026middot; \u0026middot; \u0026middot;\u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003cdiv id=\"messages\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003cdiv id=\"loading\"\u003e\u0026middot; \u0026middot; \u0026middot;\u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003cdiv id=\"result\"\u003e\u0026middot; \u0026middot; \u0026middot;\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/body\u003e\n```\n\nDon't be scared of HTML entities! They are just descriptions for different symbols, here we are using the middle dot symbol (`middot` or . ) to represent loading bubble.\n\nThe `messages` div will store all the messages between us and Orpheus, `startup` is the initial loading of the Teachable Machine model, `loading` is for Orpheus' responses, and `result` is our responses.\n\nSome of these will be invisible at first, so let's add some CSS:\n\n```css\n#result,\n#loading {\n  display: none;\n}\n```\n\n## Let's Get Orpheus to Speak!\n\n![orpheus plushie gif](https://cloud-lsz4bcbfi-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0jams_gifs.gif)\n\nNow we can create the two functions to first output the response through text onto the screen and then to output the speech\n\nWe will create 2 functions, one to output Orpheus' response to the screen and the other one to actually speak:\n\nOkay, let's get Orpheus to speak now! We will create 2 functions in the JavaScript file, one to output Orpheus' response to the screen:\n\n```js\nfunction addMessage({ role, content }) {\n  let message = document.createElement('div')\n  message.innerText = content\n  message.scrollIntoView(false) // Scroll to the message\n}\n```\n*Here we are destructuring the argument because OpenAI returns responses as `{role, content}`* \n\nAnd the other one to actually speak:\n\nIt will be an async function, which means it runs asynchronously: talking takes time and we want to make sure it finishes talking before we move onto the next thing. To do this, we use _promises_, which tell us when a function is done running and whether or not it was successful.\n\n```js\nasync function speak(message) {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =\u003e {\n    let synth = window.speechSynthesis\n    if (synth) {\n      let utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(message)\n      \n      synth.cancel()\n      synth.speak(utterance)\n      utterance.onend = resolve\n    } else {\n      reject('speechSynthesis not supported')\n    }\n  })\n}\n```\n\nThe `speak` function takes a `message` as input and returns a promise. Inside the function, it checks if the browser supports speech synthesis. If it does, it proceeds with converting the `message` into speech.\n\nIt then creates a speech utterance (to represent the text to be spoken) and sets it up with options like voice and speaking rate (which are currently commented out in the code), and cancels any ongoing speech synthesis process.\n\nAlso, if the browser doesn't support speech synthesis, it rejects the promise with a message saying that speech synthesis is not supported.\n\n#### Change Up Your AI Companion's Voice\n\nAdditionally, if you play around and add some lines of code under  `let utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(message)` you can change up the voice of your AI Companion. And there's lots of voices to choose from!\n\nThere are a lot of voices to choose from:\n\n```js\nconst voices = synth.getVoices()\nutterance.voice = voices[voices.findIndex(voice =\u003e voice.name === 'Good News')]\nutterance.rate = 1\n```\n\nPlay around with the voices! You can find a list of some voices [here](https://codepen.io/matt-west/full/DpmMgE). *(Try out Good News, it's hilarious!)*\n\nAnd finally, let's edit up our already existing `listen` function:\n\n```js\nrecognizer.listen(\n  result =\u003e {\n    const orpheusNoise = result.scores[1]\n    if (orpheusNoise \u003e THRESHOLD) {\n      speak('Hey').then(() =\u003e {\n        console.log(\"Done speaking\")\n      })\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    includeSpectrogram: true,\n    probabilityThreshold: 0.75,\n    invokeCallbackOnNoiseAndUnknown: true,\n    overlapFactor: 0.5\n  }\n)\n```\n\nIn case it wasn't obvious enough, here is what we changed:\n\n![before and after for code](https://cloud-8s76y8brd-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0jams_gifs.png)\n\nNotice that we replaced `console.log` with `speak('Hey!').then(() =\u003e ...)`. Because we used promises, we can say, once speak is done done running, we can **then** move on to the next thing, which is `console.log`ging \"Done speaking\n\nWe need to also implement the `listening` variable so that Orpheus isn't listening and speaking at the same time that it is listening! It will tell Orpheus whether or not she should be speaking or listening *(that way, listening doens't overlap with Orpheus speaking, which could lead to problems).*\n\nInitialize the following variable at the beginning of your program:\n\n```js \nlet listening = false\n```\n\nNow incorporate it in the `listen` function:\n```js\nrecognizer.listen(\n  result =\u003e {\n    const orpheusNoise = result.scores[1]\n    if (orpheusNoise \u003e THRESHOLD \u0026\u0026 !listening) {\n      listening = true\n      speak('Hey').then(() =\u003e {\n        console.log(\"Done speaking\")\n        listening = false\n      })\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    includeSpectrogram: true,\n    probabilityThreshold: 0.75,\n    invokeCallbackOnNoiseAndUnknown: true,\n    overlapFactor: 0.5\n  }\n)\n```\n\nAnd finally we need to call the `init` function at the end!\n\n```js\ninit()\n```\n\n## Full Code and Demo\n\n```js\nconst URL = 'https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/models/hiSl8IOc-/'\nconst THRESHOLD = 0.9\n\nlet listening = false\n\nasync function speak(message) {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =\u003e {\n    let synth = window.speechSynthesis\n    if (synth) {\n      let utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(message)\n      const voices = synth.getVoices()\n      utterance.voice = voices[voices.findIndex(voice =\u003e voice.name === 'Good News')]\n      utterance.rate = 1\n      synth.cancel()\n      synth.speak(utterance)\n      utterance.onend = resolve\n    } else {\n      reject('speechSynthesis not supported')\n    }\n  })\n}\n\nfunction addMessage({ role, content }) {\n  let message = document.createElement('div')\n  message.innerText = content\n  message.scrollIntoView(false)\n}\n\nwindow.onload = () =\u003e {\n  let recognizer;\n\n  async function createModel() {\n    const checkpointURL = URL + 'model.json'\n    const metadataURL = URL + 'metadata.json'\n\n    const recognizer = speechCommands.create(\n      'BROWSER_FFT',\n      undefined,\n      checkpointURL,\n      metadataURL\n    )\n\n    await recognizer.ensureModelLoaded()\n\n    return recognizer\n  }\n\n  async function init() {\n    recognizer = await createModel()\n\n    recognizer.listen(\n      result =\u003e {\n        const orpheusNoise = result.scores[1]\n        if (orpheusNoise \u003e THRESHOLD \u0026\u0026 !listening) {\n          listening = true\n          speak('Hey').then(() =\u003e {\n            console.log(\"Done speaking\")\n            listening = false\n          })\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        includeSpectrogram: true,\n        probabilityThreshold: 0.75,\n        invokeCallbackOnNoiseAndUnknown: true,\n        overlapFactor: 0.5\n      }\n    )\n  }\n\n  init()\n}\n```\n\n\u003cvideo src=\"https://cloud-18r0fzw3m-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0jams_gifs__1_.mp4\" controls=\"controls\" style={{maxWidth: \"720px\"}}\u003e\u003c/video\u003e\n\n## Additional Challenge Hacking!

We then used the Replit online IDE to create an empty site that would print a message in the console every time the keyword was detected to be said.\n\n![console printing response to keyword being said](https://cloud-2sz1omo3w-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nIn the second part of the Jams, we gave Orpheus a voice! Now instead of printing out a message in the console, our AI Companion would speak and say it out loud.\n\n\u003cvideo src=\"https://cloud-18r0fzw3m-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0jams_gifs__1_.mp4\" controls=\"controls\" style={{maxWidth: \"720px\"}}\u003e\u003c/video\u003e\nNow in the third part of the Jams, we will allow Orpheus to convert the speech that we say when we talk to it into text.\n\n*Reminder: If you're ever stuck or confused ~~or have a spelling mistake in your code that your IDE isn't catching but continues to break the whole program~~, try asking [AI such as ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) to figure it out for you!*\n\n### **Outline:**\n1. **Enter The Code Editor** *(start coding in your browser)*\n2. **Set Up the HTML Some More** *(visualize the conversation with AI)*\n3. **Let's Get Orpheus to Speak!** *(text to speech recognition!)*\n\nFirst let's store the history of our messages in our:\n\n```js\nlet messages = []\n```\n\nGo in and update the `addMessage` function.\n\n```js\nfunction addMessage({ role, content }) {\n  let message = document.createElement('div')\n  message.innerText = content\n  document.getElementById(\"messages\").appendChild(message);\n  \n  if (role === 'user') message.classList.add('user')\n  else message.classList.add('system')\n  document.getElementById('messages').appendChild(message)\n  message.scrollIntoView(false) // Scroll to the message\n}\n\n```\n\nNow we are going to add a new async function that we're calling `hear`. Essentially, we are:\n\n- Creating new instance of `SpeechRecognition()`\n- Starting it with `recognition.start()`\n- Adding an event listener to it so that when the user is done speaking, so we can get a transcript of what the user said\n- Stopping the listening with `recognition.stop()`\n- And finally, returning the transcript successfully\n\n``` js\nasync function hear() {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =\u003e {\n    let SpeechRecognition =\n      window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition\n    let recognition = new SpeechRecognition()\n    recognition.start()\n    recognition.addEventListener('result', function (event) {\n      let current = event.resultIndex\n      let transcript = event.results[current][0].transcript\n      recognition.stop()\n      resolve(transcript)\n\n    })\n  })\n}\n```\n\nNow we can actually put it to use! We are going to edit the `recognizer.listen` function again so that after Orpheus says \"Hey\", she will start listening to us. This is how the code will look now:\n\n```js\nrecognizer.listen(\n  result =\u003e {\n    const orpheusNoise = result.scores[1]\n    if (orpheusNoise \u003e THRESHOLD \u0026\u0026 !listening) {\n      listening = true\n      speak('Hey!').then(() =\u003e {\n        hear().then(response =\u003e {\n          console.log(response)\n        })\n      })\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    includeSpectrogram: true,\n    probabilityThreshold: 0.75,\n    invokeCallbackOnNoiseAndUnknown: true,\n    overlapFactor: 0.5\n  }\n)\n```\n\nHere's the edit you just made, if it's not obvious enough.\n\n![before and after image](https://cloud-oqe6fu130-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0jams_gifs.png)\n\n## See It In Action!\n\nNow when you refresh the page, you should see the flow come to life:\n\nTry saying the keyword and Orpheus will say \"Hey\" back.\n\nNow try saying something else to your AI Companion and watch as it `console.log`s what you said! Woah! \n\n![console.log of speech](https://cloud-mzlajhso5-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nAnd now do you see how useful promises are? We can wait for `speak()` to finish before we start `hear()`ing, and then only after the computer is done hearing do we log the message.\n\nThe last thing to do in this workshop is to get this message to the screen when the user is done. We do also want to show a loading bubble while we're speaking. Here's how the final `recognizer.listen` function will look like:\n\n```js\nrecognizer.listen(\n  result =\u003e {\n    const orpheusNoise = result.scores[1]\n    if (orpheusNoise \u003e THRESHOLD \u0026\u0026 !listening) {\n      listening = true\n      speak('Hey!').then(() =\u003e {\n        document.getElementById('result').style.display = 'block'\n        hear().then(response =\u003e {\n          document.getElementById('result').style.display = 'none'\n\n          let message = { role: 'user', content: response }\n          addMessage(message)\n          document.getElementById('loading').style.display = 'block'\n          \n        })\n      })\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    includeSpectrogram: true,\n    probabilityThreshold: 0.75,\n    invokeCallbackOnNoiseAndUnknown: true,\n    overlapFactor: 0.5\n  }\n)\n```\n\nNow the process is:\n1. Say hi to Orpheus\n2. Orpheus responds \"Hey\"\n3. Our bubble pops up\n4. We start talking\n5. The loading bubble disappears and our message shows up on the screen\n\nYay! Now Orpheus can hear you and convert your voice into text.\n\n![final demo of speech being printed as text on screen](https://cloud-d37x8o6qj-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\n## Additional Challenge Hacking! (recommended)\n\nIt's that time you've all been waiting for! Let's Hack our Jam! Try doing one of the following:\n![jam hacks](https://cloud-f7mhrygov-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0jam_hacks_2.gif)\n\n- Change up your character! We're doing Orpheus but you don't have to.\n- Our UI is also going to look like a smart phone \u0026 text messaging system. But I encourage everyone to do their own play on this AI Companion. What if your screen has a sound visualizer?\n\n## Stay Tuned To Build Your Very Own Smart Voice Assistant\n\nWe now have a model that can understand what we are saying and convert that speech into text. But a good friend can't just listen! They also need to talk back!\n\nIn the next part, we'll dive deeper into APIs and integrate the OpenAI GPT-3.5 language model for chat completions. This is the most pivotal step and will give our AI Companion the skill of having a conversation with us.\n"

We then used the Replit online IDE to create an empty site that would print a message in the console every time the keyword was detected to be said.\n\n![console printing response to keyword being said](https://cloud-2sz1omo3w-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nIn the second part of the Jams, we gave Orpheus a voice! Now instead of printing out a message in the console, our AI Companion would speak and say it out loud.\n\n\u003cvideo src=\"https://cloud-18r0fzw3m-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0jams_gifs__1_.mp4\" controls=\"controls\" style={{maxWidth: \"720px\"}}\u003e\u003c/video\u003e\nIn the third part of the Jams, we gave Orpheus the power to convert our speech into text.\n\nNow, in the fourth and final part, we will finally incorporate the OpenAI API to utilize the GPT 3.5 model. Ever heard of ChatGPT? OpenAI built it and invested years and billions of dollars to create the dataset that you will be using for your AI Companion.\n\n### **Outline:**\n1. **Set-Up and Get Your API Key** *(quick intro into APIs)*\n2. **Idea Generation** *(set up idea generation with the OpenAI API)*\n3. **Now Text Completion!** *(set up text completion with the OpenAI API)*\n4. **Final Function**\n\n## Set-Up and Get Your API Key:\n\n1. Make an account and login to https://platform.openai.com/\n2. Go to API keys and create a new API key. *Make sure to save it! never share it! As you can see in the demo, we haven't provided our own API key in the project for this reason.*\n\n![API keys on OpenAI](https://cloud-n3hgshowm-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nWe will be using GPT-3.5 or GPT-4, the most accessible and recently updated set of models that can understand \u0026 generate both natural language and code. There are also [models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview) such as Whisper (that can convert audio into text) or Dall-e (that can generate and edit images based on a prompt).\n\n##### There's Two Parts to Implementing a Text Model\nFirstly, the AI needs to be able to generate its own ideas. Next, the AI must complete text suggestions, such as how Google tries to guess what you're searching.\n\n![google autocomplete](https://cloud-ae241kl1y-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nThis will allow us to have a conversation with the AI!\n\n## Idea Generation\n\n1. Use this endpoint: \n`POST https://api.openai.com/v1/completions`\n\nAPIs are really simple! there's 4 main requests for HTTP request methods:\n\n\u003e APIs (or Application Programming Interfaces) are like a digital restaurant, they are the waiter that goes between you (the client) and the kitchen (the server). Requests are sent from you the client to the server to perform actions.\n\n![digital restaurant gif](https://cloud-lk53rqdly-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0bb312c00-400b-4da4-bc6a-6fbd2a91cca4.gif)\n\n\u003ctable\u003e\n  \u003cthead\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003cth\u003eMethod\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003cth\u003eDescription\u003c/th\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/thead\u003e\n  \u003ctbody\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eGET\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eRetrieve information\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003ePOST\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eSend information\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003ePUT/PATCH\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eUpdate information\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eDELETE\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eDelete information\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/tbody\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n\n\n2. Here we are fetching the API and using the post method to send information:\n\n``` js\nfetch(\"https://api.openai.com/v1/completions\", {  \n\tmethod: \"POST\",  \n\theaders: {  \n\tAuthorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,\n\t\"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"  \n\t},  \n\tbody: JSON.stringify()  \n})\n```\n\n3.  Let's add what model we're using *(this is the only not optional step)*! remember you can find a list of all models here, but only some can be used for text completion and generation.\n\n```js\nfetch(\"https://api.openai.com/v1/completions\", {  \n\tmethod: \"POST\",  \n\theaders: {  \n\tAuthorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,\n\t\"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"  \n\t},  \n\tbody: JSON.stringify({\n\t\tmodel: \"gpt-3.5-turbo\"\n\t})  \n})\n```\n\n4. Next let's put in a prompt. this will be a string that will be sent to the API to generate text for\n\n```js\nfetch(\"https://api.openai.com/v1/completions\", {  \n\tmethod: \"POST\",  \n\theaders: {  \n\tAuthorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,\n\t\"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"  \n\t},  \n\tbody: JSON.stringify({\n\t\tmodel: \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n\t\tprompt: \"hi! how are you?\"\n\t})  \n})\n```\n\n5. Next we'll add `max_tokens`  to take an integer value for the largest value of tokens to generate in the completion.\n```js\nfetch(\"https://api.openai.com/v1/completions\", {  \n\tmethod: \"POST\",  \n\theaders: {  \n\tAuthorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,\n\t\"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"  \n\t},  \n\tbody: JSON.stringify({\n\t\tmodel: \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n\t\tprompt: \"what should i do today?\",\n\t\tmax_tokens: 6\n\t})  \n})\n```\n\nTokens are common sequences of characters found in text and what the models use to process it.\n\nThe OpenAI tokenizer (https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer) can be used to visually demonstrate how an API would tokenize a string of text, as well as how many tokens it would be.\n\n![tokenizer](https://cloud-1sxrk5p2x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\n*General rule: 1 token generally corresponds to ~4 characters of text for common English text or 3/4 of a word. this is roughly 100 tokens ~= 75 words.*\n\n6. Here are a few more options that you can use! pick and choose from the following to see what they can do: \n\n| Name | Description | Restrictions |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- | \n| temperature | this is a value from zero to two, where higher values will make the output more random, and lower values will make the output more focused and deterministic. | cannot be used with top_p \n| top_p | nucleus sample: where the model only considers the tokens with the top_p probability mass | cannot be used with temperature |\n| n | allows us to assert how many completions are generated for each prompt | doing this will take more tokens, so be mindful\n| user | will represent end-user to help openai detect/monitor abuse |\n*Check out [OpenAI API Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) for more options that you can use!*\n\n## Now Let's Add Some Code!\n\n*Tip: If you feel like you ever need help or someone to double-check your work during any part of the following process, feel free to \"pair-program\" with ChatGPT! Just copy and paste your code and question into the box and read the AI's reply.*\n\nGo to our script.js file and make a new function called `answer` to insert our fetch request in!\n\n```js\nasync function answer(message) {\n\treturn new Promise((resolve, reject) =\u003e {\n\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nLet's create a function called fetchData and make is async.\n\n```js\nasync function fetchData(){\n\n}\n```\n\nNow inside the brackets type `const response = await fetch()` to save the fetched data in the constant variable response. Go to the [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions) and get that URL that is stated and put it in the `fetch()`.\n\nYour code should now look like this. This goes to the completions endpoint.\n\n```js\nasync function fetchData(){\n\tconst response = await fetch(\"https://api.openai.com/v1/completions\")\n}\n```\n\n3. Next we're going to pass through all our options that we were looking at before. so in the curly brackets let's pass through the method (a post method) as well as some headers.\n\n```js\nasync function fetchData(){\n\tconst response = await fetch(\"https://api.openai.com/v1/completions\",{\n\t\tmethod: \"POST\",\n\t\theaders:{\n\t\t\t\n\t\t}\t\n\t})\n}\n```\n\nBut what goes in headers? For starters our API key needs to be passed through, and for that we'll use authorization.\n\nBack at the beginning of the code, let's create another constant to store that string of letters and numbers that you retrieved from openai earlier:\n\n```js\nconst API_KEY = \"insert your private API KEY here\"\n```\nAnd in the headers brackets add this line:\n\n```js\nAuthorization: 'Bearer' ${API_KEY},\n```\n\n4. Now let's also define our content type in the brackets and we're going to be working with json.\n\n```js\n\"Content-Type: \"application/json\"\n```\n\nYou should now have this:\n\n```js\nconst API_KEY = \"insert your private API KEY here\"\nasync function fetchData(){\n\tconst response = await fetch(\"https://api.openai.com/v1/completions\", {\n\tmethod: \"POST\",\n\theaders: {\n      Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,\n      \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"\n    },  \n\t\n\t})\n}\n```\n\n5. We're going to have to pass through the options that we saw after the headers. We're using json to pass the text and \"text-davinci-003\" as the model for now (we will change this to gpt-3.5 or gpt-4 later).\n\n```js\nbody: JSON.stringify({\n      model: \"text-davinci-003\",\n      prompt: \"what should i do today?\",\n      max_token: 6\n    })\n```\n\n6. And now finally, we are going to get the response as json, but since it's also an async method we have to use await and save it in a variable. and of course, let's use `alert` to display the data as an alert on screen.\n\n```js\nconst data = await response.json()\nalert(data)\n```\n\nCheck your code!\n\n```js\nconst API_KEY = \"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\"\nasync function fetchData() {\n  const response = await fetch(\"https://api.openai.com/v1/completions\", {\n    method: \"POST\",\n    headers: {\n      Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,\n      \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"\n    },\n    body: JSON.stringify({\n      model: \"text-davinci-003\",\n      prompt: \"what should i do today?\",\n      max_token: 6\n    })\n  })\n  const data = await response.json()\n  alert(data)\n}\n```\n\nBut there's one last important step: call your function, silly!\n```js\nfetchData()\n```\n\n## Now Text Completion\n\nLet's use this knowledge to build an AI that also supports text completion. This will allow us to have full conversations with the AI.\n\nI'll be using gpt-3.5 as my model this time.\n\nAnd our new endpoint will be `POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions` (note: /chat for chat completions)\n\n1. Make sure all the required things are added into the script.js file (from the last section):\n\t- the API key which you must retrieve and save in an variable\n\t- the content type\n\t- and the model (all models here: https://platform.openai.com/docs/models)\n\n```js\nconst API_KEY = \"insert your private API key here\"\nasync function fetchData() {\n  const response = await fetch(\"https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\", {\n    method: \"POST\",\n    headers: {\n      Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,\n      \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"\n    },\n    body: JSON.stringify({\n      model: \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n    })\n  })\n}\n```\n\n2. An additional requirement this time is to include `messages`. messages are a list of messages comprising the conversation so far. [Example Python code](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/How_to_format_inputs_to_ChatGPT_models.ipynb)\n\n```js\nmessages:[{\n        role: \"user\",\n        content:\"Hello!\"\n      }]\n```\n\n3. Now let's put that data somewhere and call the function you just made.\n\n```js\nconst data = await response.json()\nconsole.log(data)\n```\n\nFull code:\n```js\nconst API_KEY = \"insert your private API key here\"\nasync function fetchData() {\n  const response = await fetch(\"https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\", {\n    method: \"POST\",\n    headers: {\n      Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,\n      \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"\n    },\n    body: JSON.stringify({\n      model: \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n      messages:[{\n        role: \"user\",\n        content:\"Hello!\"\n      }]\n    })\n  })\n  const data = await response.json()\n  console.log(data)\n}\n\nfetchData()\n```\n\n## Final Function\n\nOkay, great, but we need to use the function. The first thing we'll do is create one last function (I promise!) called `process` so our code doesn't get too messy:\n\n```js\nasync function process() {\n  document.getElementById('result').style.display = 'block'\n\n  hear().then(result =\u003e {\n    document.getElementById('result').style.display = 'none'\n\n    let message = { role: 'user', content: result }\n    addMessage(message)\n    document.getElementById('loading').style.display = 'block'\n\n    answer(message).then(response =\u003e {\n      response.role = 'system'\n\n      messages.push(response)\n      addMessage(response)\n\n      document.getElementById('loading').style.display = 'none'\n\n      speak(response.content).then(() =\u003e {\n        process()\n      })\n    })\n  })\n}\n```\n\nSo this is mostly the code that was in our `recognizer.listen` function. Except we added a couple parts. First up, we are now using `answer` to respond to the message.\n\nOnce we have an answer, we use `addMessage` to add it to the screen, and then use `speak` so Orpheus can speak it out loud.\n\nAfter Orpheus is done speaking, we can repeat the process, so the computer will keep listening to us.\n\nAnd finally, let's replace `recognizer.listen` now:\n\n```js\nrecognizer.listen(\n  result =\u003e {\n    const orpheusNoise = result.scores[1]\n    if (orpheusNoise \u003e THRESHOLD \u0026\u0026 !listening) {\n      listening = true\n      speak('Hey!').then(() =\u003e {\n        process()\n      })\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    includeSpectrogram: true,\n    probabilityThreshold: 0.75,\n    invokeCallbackOnNoiseAndUnknown: true,\n    overlapFactor: 0.5\n  }\n)\n```\n\nWoah, now it works! Talk to Orpheus.\n\n## Final Demo\n\nWe went further and customized ours to look like a phone, but I encourage you to go out and create your own styling :\n\n```css\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto\u0026display=swap');\n\n* {\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n}\n\nbody,\nhtml {\n  background-color: #fafafa;\n  font-family: -apple-system, 'Roboto', sans-serif;\n  margin: 0;\n  padding: 2rem 0;\n  display: flex;\n  align-items: center;\n  justify-content: center;\n}\n\n#phone {\n  aspect-ratio: 1 / 2;\n  box-shadow: 0 8px 16px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);\n  width: 375px;\n  border: 14px solid black;\n  border-radius: 28px;\n}\n\n#container {\n  position: relative;\n  background-color: white;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n  border-radius: 14px;\n  border: 1px solid white;\n  overflow-y: auto;\n}\n\n#header {\n  background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);\n  -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(2em);\n  backdrop-filter: blur(2em);\n  position: sticky;\n  top: 0;\n  border-bottom: 1px solid #e5e5e5;\n  text-align: center;\n  padding-top: 0.5rem;\n}\n\n#header img {\n  width: 80px;\n}\n\n#header p {\n  margin-top: -10px;\n}\n\n#wrapper {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n  padding: 1rem 0.5rem;\n}\n\n#messages {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n}\n\n.user {\n  background-color: #09f;\n  color: white;\n  padding: 7px 14px;\n  border-radius: 14px;\n  align-self: flex-end;\n  margin-bottom: 7px;\n}\n\n.system {\n  background-color: #eee;\n  padding: 7px 14px;\n  border-radius: 14px;\n  margin-bottom: 7px;\n  align-self: flex-start;\n}\n\n#result,\n#loading {\n  display: none;\n}\n\n```\n\n## Final Demo\n\u003cvideo src=\"https://cloud-ckyxamknp-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0jams_gifs__1_.mp4\" controls=\"controls\" style={{maxWidth: \"720px\"}}\u003e\u003c/video\u003e\n\n## Additional Challenge Hacking! (recommended)\n\nIt's that time you've all been waiting for! Let's Hack our Jam! Try doing one of the following:\n![jam hacks](https://cloud-f7mhrygov-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0jam_hacks_2.gif)\n\nUse any one of the APIs in your own project. Here are some examples:\n\n- DIY transcript app by connecting YouTube videos to SpeechRecognition API!\n- Train Teachable Machine to do other things! JC has a guitar so she was thinking of recognizing chords to make her own Guitar Hero\n- What if you had a password to unlock your assistant? Train Teachable Machine to recognize you drawing digits in the air to unlock your assistant!\n- Redesign the UI! Ours is a phone but maybe yours is Jarvis\n- Add messages to `localStorage` so your AI can remember what it asked you last time!\n\n## Congratulations!\n\nYou've created a project with artificial intelligence and machine learning. Now go forth and be hacky!\n\n![orpheus celebration dance](https://cloud-12ntu5q74-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0jams_gifs__1_.gif)\n"

The rest of this workshop will assume you know how to draw a schematic from pictures.\n\n{/* Ideally a better version of this video will be made by a Hack Clubber, but this is the best basic video we have now */}\n[This YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPH23zhPg50) demonstrates the basics of navigating around KiCAD.\n\nIn addition, the rest of the workshop assumes you know basic electronics terms like:\n1. Resistor: A resistor limits the electric current that flows through a circuit. Resistance is the restriction of current.\n2. Capacitor: A capacitor stores charge, and thus energy. It's like a tiny battery that charges and discharges very quickly.\n3. Diode: A diode only allows current to flow in one direction. It also drops a little bit of voltage, turning that energy into heat.\n2. Microcontroller: A microcontroller (aka MCU) is a system on a chip that contains an integrated processor, memory, and input/output peripherals, which are used to interact with other electronic components.\n\n## Part Selection\n\nStep 0 of designing a board is to clearly define what problem you need the board to solve. Here, we are making a nice looking level. The primary goal is to demonstrate electronics and PCB concepts. A secondary goal is to have an attractive and fun level.\n\nStep 1 of designing a board is selecting your core components:\n\n1. Microcontroller: ATmega328P. The ATmega series is the most robust and common 8-bit MCUs, being used in many Arduinos since the beginning. Additionally, it requires very few external components and runs over a wide range of voltages (1.8V-5.5V). It's also one of the very few microcontrollers that is a *Basic Part* on JLCPCB. And, it's available in a QFP package so it can be hand-soldered. It doesn't have many fancy features, but it's simple and robust.\n\n2. USB-Serial Interface: CH340N. Because the ATmega328P doesn't have a built-in USB interface, we need a USB-UART IC. The CH340C worked well for @Hugo[^1], and it's very cheap, so I'm using the CH340N. The CH340N is the cheapest IC from the CH340 series that has an integrated clock, meaning fewer components are needed.\n\n3. Pinout: While not technically a component, we will follow the standard Arduino Nano pinout. This really doesn't matter— unless you value your future self's sanity when trying to wire up new components.\n\nNow on to the actual circuit.\nMake sure you have KiCAD downloaded, then set up a new project, and open the schematic editor.\n\n## Core (Microcontroller)\n\nFirst, we place the heart of our system, the ATmega328P-AU, in a TQFP package [Search: ATmega328P-A]. This is NOT the ATmega328PB, which is not backward compatible with the ATmega328P.\n\n### Power\n\n![](https://cloud-j48wmzjac-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/21.webp)\n\nThen, we need to connect the power pins to power *nets* and place *decoupling capacitors*.\n\n**Nets**: Nets like VCC and GND serve as abstractions for actual connections in our schematic. If we connected every single chip to a central VCC and GND point in our schematic, it would be very messy. These symbols tell the PCB Designer that we need to connect those pins while keeping the schematic clean.\n\n**Decoupling Capacitors**: AKA Bypass Capacitors. A decoupling capacitor is placed very close to the chip that needs or supplies power. When a chip suddenly demands power, it provides it while the battery and other components ramp up, essentially like a dam controls a river. When there are voltage spikes or noise, it absorbs them, while letting normal DC power pass along. So, these have to be as physically close to their parent IC as possible in the PCB layout (in Part 2).\n\nIn the KiCAD parts list, search `C` and after placing it change the *value* field to the correct number and units, 100nF in this case.\n\nYour *reference designator* numbers for C may be different from the image (C1 and C2). VCC and GND are also parts that can be imported like any other parts. And feel free to delete the labels on GND to reduce clutter.\n\n### Clock\n\n![](https://cloud-j48wmzjac-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/32.webp)\nThe datasheet for our crystal, C13738, shows that pins 2 and 4 are connected to ground [Search: Crystal_GND24].\n\nNow that our MCU is powered, it needs a clock to tick to[^3]. We can configure the ATmega328P to use this 16MHz crystal rather than run at its default of 1MHz.\n\nThis crystal needs an accompanying capacitor connected to ground on each pin. \n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\n\u003csummary\u003eHow did I come up with the value of these capacitors?\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n```\nC = 2 * CL - CS\n```\nHere, C is the capacitor we need, CL is the load capacitance specified by the crystal manufacturer, and CS is the stray capacitance of the microcontroller pin. In our case CL (of the crystal) is 9pF and CS (of XTAL1/2) is 6pF (as specified by the datasheet).\n\nSo, we use 12pF capacitors.\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n[^3]: Yes, while the ATmega328P does have an internal clock, it's kinda inaccurate and could cause issues with serial communications. The simple and safe choice is to use an external crystal which are typically accurate to 20 parts per million, a opposed to the 5% (5 parts per hundred) of the ATmega's intenal clock.\n\n### Reset\n![](https://cloud-j48wmzjac-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/43.webp)\n\nThe bar on top of RESET means that it is active low, GND (0V) will reset the MCU and it should be at VCC (5V) during normal operation. The SPST button here is JLCPCB's basic push button which connects RESET to ground when pressed [Search: SW_SPST]. \n\nThe resistor R6 [Search: R] is a pull-up resistor, a high-resistance resistor that gently pulls the RESET pin HIGH without passing too much current through it. This allows the switch to pull the RESET pin down without causing a short circuit, while preventing random noise from pulling RESET down.\n\nLabeling this wire as RESET connects it to the RESET *net*. If we place another RESET label somewhere else on this page, our ECAD tool will understand that these two points have to be connected, just like the GND and VCC nets. Press \"L\" to activate the label tool.\n\n\n### Label Pinout\n\n![image](https://cloud-j48wmzjac-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/54.webp)\n\nAfter this, we need labels telling us which MCU pin is which Arduino Nano pin.\n\nThese are global labels. Unlike the RESET label, these work on all pages of the schematic. You can press \"CTRL+L\" to create a gloabl label.\n\n## Headers\n\n![](https://cloud-nbfq15yho-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/15.png)\n\nFirst, we have the traditional Arduino Nano pinout [Search: Arduino_Nano_v3] connected to our labels, telling the ECAD software we want these headers connected to the prespecified microcontroller pins. Since this whole board is running at 5V, just mark 3V3 as NC (No Connect).\n\nWe also have the ICSP header [Search: Conn_02x03_Odd_Even], which is used for flashing the Arduino's bootloader. It has all the SPI pins in one neat package, MISO, MOSI, SCK, RESET, VCC, GND.\n\nOnce you have a label, you can press 'x' to flip it horizontally.\n\n## USB\n\nWe start with the 16 Pin USB 2.0 Type C receptacle, C165948.\n\n![image](https://cloud-mu5k1d6dk-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1usb.png)\n\nNC: SBU1/2 and Shield/Shell (shield is only for hosts).\n\nGND goes to our ground net.\n\nMark VBUS with a net, and then run it through a diode [Search: D] to the VCC net, which powers everything else on this board. \n\nSince we will be powering a bunch of LEDs, I picked a big diode JLCPCB had as a basic part, C35722. Set the *value* field to the part number so you can find it later. This diode prevents current from going back into your computer if both USB and 5V pins are plugged in.\n\nThen, to tell the USB-C port that we are drawing power from it, CC1 and CC2 have to each be connected through separate 5.1k resistors to ground[^4]. That tells the USB-C power adapter that we can draw up to 5V 3A.\n\nYou can download the KiCAD CH340N footprint here: [ch340n.kicad_sym](https://cloud-b6v3rkn29-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0ch340n.kicad_sym). Then, put it in your project folder and add it to your symbol library in Preferences \u003e Manage Symbol Libraries \u003e Project Specific Libraries.\n\n![](https://cloud-j48wmzjac-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/87.1.webp)\n![](https://cloud-j48wmzjac-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/97.2.webp)\n\n![image](https://cloud-mu5k1d6dk-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0ch.png)\n\nNow, we can connect our UART chip, the CH340N. Both D+ and D- from the USB-C connector go to D+/- on the CH340N. As specified in its datasheet, both V3 and VCC get 100nF decoupling capacitors. RTS goes to RESET through another 100nF capacitor; this capacitor makes the RESET pin briefly pulse low instead of staying low forever (avoiding bootlooping the MCU).\n\nRXD and TXD (USB directionality), are connected to their microcontroller pins D1 (MCU's TX) and D0 (MCU's RX) respectively with some status LEDs [Search: LED, Value: GREEN/YELLOW].\n\n[^4]: 5k1 is just a concise and clear EE way of saying 5.1k. The units are context dependent, so here it means kilo - ohms.\n\n## Done!\n\nNow you have a simple Arduino Nano-compatible board schematic! Check out Part 2 to turn this into a PCB, or jump to Part 3 to add more features to this board[^2].\n\n![](https://cloud-mu5k1d6dk-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/201full-kicad.svg)\n\n{/* footnotes */}\n\n[^1]: Thanks to Hugo Hu for his instructable, this schematic is based on that design: https://www.instructables.com/ATmega328P-Corgi-Arduino/\n\n[^2]: **WARNING**: You will need another microcontroller board to flash the bootloader on this ATmega328P before you can program this board. Ask in Slack if you have ANY questions about this.\n"

Traces: A continuous stretch of copper that connects multiple parts.\n2. Layers: Layers are parallel surfaces of *stuff* on your PCB. There are a bunch of different kinds of layers, like:\n\n\n**KiCAD Layers:** [^4]\n\n`F.Cu`/`B.Cu`: The layers of copper on your PCB. The conductive traces on your board should live on these layers. Separate conductive traces can not cross each other on the same layer, you must use a via to connect two layers and not cross traces on the same side of the board.\n\n`F.Silkscreen`/`B.Silkscreen`: The printed (silkscreened) layers on your PCB. These are either white or black and must be monochrome (you can't have gradients, everything must be a clear line). Anything can go on these layers, they are simply printed.\n\n`F.Paste`/`B.Paste`: Anything that will be soldered needs to have paste on it. You probably don't need to mess with this layer unless you know what you're doing, it should be automatically handled by your part footprints.\n\n`F.Mask`/`B.Mask`: The soldermask is the colored coating that goes on the board. By default, it covers everything except pads and is what gets printed on. Removing soldermask can be used to expose copper for cool effects.\n\nObjects \u003e Ratlines: These have no impact on the final production of your board, they are simply guides to tell you where you still need to draw traces.\n\n`Edge.Cuts`: This is the actual outline of how your board will be cut.\n\n`User.Comments`: This layer has information that will not be printed on the board and is only visible in KiCAD. Think of it as comments in your code.\n\n\nReminders:\n- Make sure you draw your traces! You shouldn't have any ratlines on your board when you send it for production.\n- Remember separate conductive traces cannot touch each other.\n- You can use a combination of layers to design the look of your board.\n- You almost always want to have the traces of your board covered with soldermask, but it's typically ok to have other copper regions exposed, just remember it might tarnish.\n- JLCPCB engineers will review manufacturing details of your design before production, if they spot any issues they'll send you an email to check it. However, don't rely on this to catch circuit issues.\n\n## Footprint assignment\n\nFootprints are the exposed copper pads on the PCB for each component. They represent the physical size and shape of the components.\n\nFirst, click on 'Run footprint assignment tool'.\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/100.webp)\n\nIn the new window, under Footprint Filters, select the first one - \"filters defined in symbol\" - but deselect the other two.\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/10.1.webp)\n\nNow, you should have a window like this with some footprints autofilled, others empty.\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/20.2.webp)\n\nSome footprints, like the Arduino Nano outline, which is not a real component in this case, only have a few options. Double-click on `Module:Arduino_Nano_WithMountingHoles` to select it.\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/30.3.webp)\n\n### Generics\n\n0402, 0603, 0805, and 1206 are common sizes of small two-terminal SMD components like resistors, capacitors, and diodes. 0805 is very common and somewhat convenient to place by hand, so we will use **0805** for all our components[^1].\n\n\u003ca title=\"Zerodamage, CC BY 3.0 \u0026lt;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0\u0026gt;, via Wikimedia Commons\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:SMT_sizes,_based_on_original_by_Zureks.svg\"\u003e\u003cimg style={{backgroundColor: \"white\"}} width=\"256\" alt=\"SMT sizes, based on original by Zureks\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/SMT_sizes%2C_based_on_original_by_Zureks.svg/256px-SMT_sizes%2C_based_on_original_by_Zureks.svg.png\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\nTo find our first capacitor, go to [jlcpcb.com/parts](https://jlcpcb.com/parts). In this case, we will search for 100nF, our first capacitor.\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/40.4.png.webp)\n\nThen, scroll down and **select \"Basic Parts\"** to find the parts that don't have the extended fee and we see that they do have 0805 available. So, click on the component and search for 0805 in footprint selection. Do this for each component.\n\nYou should find that all of the components have 0805 parts available and in stock.\n\nSpecifically, all capacitors will be: `Capacitor_SMD:C_0805_2012Metric_Pad1.18x1.45mm_HandSolder`[^21]\nall LEDs will be `LED_SMD:LED_0805_2012Metric_Pad1.15x1.40mm_HandSolder`, and all resistors will be `Resistor_SMD:R_0805_2012Metric_Pad1.20x1.40mm_HandSolder`.\n\n[^21]: These HandSolder footprints do not mean that you have to hand solder them. JLCPCB will still assemble these components for you. HandSolder footprints simply give you more space under component - just in case you need it to fix stuff. Picking the non-handsolder versions of these footprints is perfectly fine.\n\n### Specific Components\n\nIf you look up the Diode `C35722`, you will get its LCSC page, which says the package is `SMC(DO-214AB)`.\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/50.5.webp)\n\nGoing to the Datasheet also confirms this.\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/60.6.webp)\n\nThen, in KiCAD, after selecting the diode, we can search for the package. While there are no results for DO-214, SMC shows up and we can select `Diode_SMD:D_SMC_Handsoldering`.\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/70.7.webp)\n\nDo the same reseach with the Crystal to get the footprint/package.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\n\u003csummary\u003eDid you try it yourself? Click here for the Crystal's footprint.\u003c/summary\u003e\n\nLooking up the part number, C13738, for the crystal on [jlcpcb.com/parts](https://jlcpcb.com/parts) should give the package, `SMD3225`, which is the KiCAD footprint `Crystal:Crystal_SMD_3225-4Pin_3.2x2.5mm_HandSoldering`.\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\nSimilarly, for the ICSP header, you will get the right result by searching for `2.54mm` (i.e. 0.1 inch pin spacing), and `2x03` (6 pins arranged in 2x3): `Connector_PinHeader_2.54mm:PinHeader_2x03_P2.54mm_Vertical`.\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/80.8.webp)\n\n\n### Other components\n\nYou might've noticed that my original footprint assignment window had some components filled out already. This is because chips like the ATmega328P-AU only have one footprint - that's what the `AU` designates.\n\nOthers, like the switch, were found by searching for their part number, `1187A`, in the footprint window.\n\nLastly, some components like the USB-C Receptacle can be weird. While there are hundreds of different manufacturers of USB-C ports and receptacles, there are only a few common designs. However, there is no way to confirm which part uses which design without manually checking each dimension, so I just used the popular `HRO_TYPE-C-31-M-12`.\n\n---\n\nNow that our footprints are all selected, we can move on to the PCB!\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/90.9.webp)\n\n\n## PCB\n\n### Setup\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/231.webp)\n\nClick 'Open PCB in board editor' in the schematic view.\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/342.webp)\n\nIn the PCB editor, click on 'Edit board setup'. This is where we will set the constraints of our design.\n\n![](https://cloud-h0ccsbxz9-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/06.png)\n\nThen, in Design Rules \u003e Pre-defined Sizes, specify how wide you want your traces, vias, and differential pairs will be. KiCAD will let you pick between the options here when designing your board. We will set a track width of 0.3mm for signal traces, 0.5mm for power traces, and 0.7mm diameter vias with a 0.3mm hole[^6]. \n\nThen, press OK to save and exit board setup.\n\n[^6]: These sizes are just arbritary sane defaults. The point I'm illustrating is that your power traces should be big to reduce their resistance, and signal traces can be smaller. Things get more complicated if you're doing AC power, RF or audio signals, but that's way beyond the scope of this jam (and my knowlege :)).\n\n### Set Up Components\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/617.webp)\n\nNow, in the board editor window, clicking on 'Update PCB with schematic' brings in all your components to the PCB page. If you make schematic changes, you can click on this to bring in your new parts. In the Update PCB window options, check Delete footprints and Replace footprints and click on Update PCB.\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/628.webp)\n\nPlace them off to the side for now.\n\n\n### Board Edges\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/639.webp)\n\nNow, to define the edges of our board, select the `Edge.Cuts` layer in the layer menu.\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1110.webp)\n\nYou can use the shape tools to draw the outline of the board, or...\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1211.webp)\n\nyou can go to File \u003e Import \u003e Graphics to import a custom **SVG**. You can **pick whatever shape you like here**.\n\n\u003e *Note*: In part 3 of this jam, we will be adding more features such as an LED strip and accelerometer to make a level. Make sure your design will support the physical realities of being a level, such as having two points to balance on, which do not have any ports. Also, consider how your LEDs will physically and aesthetically fit.  Make a rough paper sketch if that helps.\n\u003e Of course, none of this applies to you if you have different plans for your board.\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1312.webp)\n\nBy default, your drawing probably won't fit the Arduino Nano template.\n\nDelete the first import and go back to File \u003e Import \u003e Graphics. Play with the scale setting until your design snugly fits the Arduino Nano template (while leaving space for other components).\n\n\u003e This step will take some trial and error.\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1413.webp)\n\nClean up the drawing to only leave one continuous board shape.\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1615.webp)\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1514.webp)\n\nDouble-click the shape and set it up like the image above.\n- Not Locked\n- Not Filled\n- Line width: 0.6mm\n- Line Style: Solid\n- Layer: Edge.Cuts\n\n\u003e In case you don't have a nice SVG, but do have a solid shape image, try KiCAD's Bitmap to Component converter. Paste the Footprint into your PCB design, Right Click \u003e Edit Footprint, and follow the above steps.\n\n### Components\n\n\u003e Note: Many of the choices in this section will depend upon your outline. Feel free to ask for help in [#onboard-help](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C0593MG26TT) on Slack.\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1817.a.webp)\n\nAfter you position the Board Edge and Arduino Template, lock them in place (Select Both \u003e Right Click \u003e Locking \u003e Lock) to avoid accidentally moving them.\n\nThen, start placing the major components: USB Port, ICs, Microcontroller, buttons, etc. \n\n**Have your schematic split screened with the PCB layout**. Whenever you click on a component in one, it will be focused in the other. This way, you see what passives[^20] go with which major components and you can place them logically near each other. The decoupling capacitors for an IC must be right next to it.\n\n[^20]: Resistors, capacitors, diodes, etc. In this context, equivalent to minor/support components.\n\nRotate them to a position that'll make running traces convenient. For example, you want the D+ and D- pins of the USB controller to be facing the port, and the TX, RX pins to be facing your microcontroller. You can rotate things 90 degrees by pressing 'R' on your keyboard, or set a 45 degree offset for the MCU by going to properties.\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1917.webp)\n\nThis is how I roughly laid out the core components within the Arduino Nano footprint. Some large components like the reset switch and diode are outside the main nano footprint. The red pads indicate that these are all on the `F.Cu` layer. This is the front of the PCB. While a typical Nano design needs to be two-sided (have components on both the front and back) to fit within that footprint, here, we will make a larger, one-sided board to keep assembly costs down.\n\n\u003e You have to be clever and very deliberate with the placement for your components so minimize the amount of wiring going around other things. Spending a little bit more time on this step will make your routing life sooo much easier. Take inspiration from my layout, but you can't just copy it becase my reference numbers are different. Look at the schematic and see which component connects to what.\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/2018.webp)\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/2219.webp)\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/2119.5.webp)\n\n\n\u003e Note: This layout took several rounds of iteration between layout and trace routing to generate. It's absolutely fine, and in fact, necessary to come back to rearrange your components if you find your layout doesn't work when routing traces. If this is your first complex board, you'll quickly find that learning routing is the most tedious part of your board, but obviously necessary to get your board working.\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/2420.webp)\n\nWhile laying out your board, the 3D viewer is a very useful tool. Use \"Alt+3\" to open it.\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/2521.webp)\n\nIf some components are not visible, go back to your board design and double-click the part to open properties.\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/2622.webp)\n\nMake sure you're in properties for the whole component, not just one pad or silkscreen, and then open the '3D Models' tab. Click on the file browser for the 3D model line. These are the correct models:\n\n- USB Connector: `${KICAD7_3DMODEL_DIR}/Connector_USB.3dshapes/USB_C_Receptacle_GCT_USB4105-xx-A_16P_TopMnt_Horizontal.wrl`\n- CH340N: `${KICAD7_3DMODEL_DIR}/Package_SO.3dshapes/SOIC-8_3.9x4.9mm_P1.27mm.wrl`\n- SW1: `${KICAD7_3DMODEL_DIR}/Button_Switch_SMD.3dshapes/SW_SPST_TL3342.wrl`\n\nThese may vary based on your version of KiCAD.\n\n### Routing\n\nTo route tracks, follow the Ratsnest (thin blue lines connecting matching nets), and connect the pads. Look at the schematic to see which parts should go where. **Start with data signals, and do power and ground later**. An efficient layout, one that uses less wires, is often the mostly aesthetically pleasing too.\n\nTry to use the higher thickness 0.5mm trace for sensitive applications like the decoupling capacitors, clock, power lines, etc if you can fit it, and 0.3mm for regular data lines[^6].\n\n![](https://cloud-mu5k1d6dk-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/4screenshot_20230921_041203.png)\n\nThe following images are how router the traces:\n\nNote: You can press \"x\" when hovering over a pad to start a trace.\n\nIn the Appearance sidebar go to Objects \u003e Locked Item Shadow, and hide it to clean up your layout a little bit. Feel free to play with the opacities of other elements to get to a point that you are comfortable with.\n\n![](https://cloud-5127rirqc-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/023.webp)\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/2824.webp)\n\nThe purple lines are the 'Courtyard' - they show you how close two components can be without physically interfering, so, you keep the decoupling capacitor and IC's courtyards very close to each other.\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/2925.webp)\n\nAnd then, connect the microcontroller pins. In my layout A0-A5, D0, D1, D5-D13 can be routed on the top layer as shown above.\n\n\u003e I have to emphasize, this is just what I came up with. This is not the right layout, this is not the best layout. It's one out of the infinite possible arrangements of these traces.\n\n\n### Two-layer routing\n\nNow because there is no way to connect D4 of the microcontroller to the header pin, we will have to jump layers. A via is a tiny hole in your board that connects traces on two sides. It's drilled into the PCB and filled (or plated) with copper to connect the two sides.\n\nFirst, press 'X' to start running a trace away from D4, towards the inside of the microcontroller.\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/3026.webp)\n\nMove to some empty space then press 'v' to create a via.\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/3127.webp)\n\nClick to place the via, and now you can drag a blue trace - on the back side of the board.\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/3228.webp)\n\nClick on D4. Since D4 and other pins are through holes, you can connect traces from either layer to them.\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/3329.webp)\n\nJust like D4, use vias on A6, A7, D2, and D3 to reach their respective header pins. \n- If your via is too close to a pad, solder might flow into it and prevent the pad from being properly attached. So, even though KiCAD doesn't stop you from doing that, stay a safe distance away from pads.\n- Note how this uses vias to cross A6 and A7. This prevents us from having to run A7 all the way outside the headers to loop around.\n\nYou can click on the blue `B.Cu` layer in the Layers sidebar to visually bring the back layer traces to the front.\n\n![](https://cloud-5127rirqc-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/130.webp)\n\nJust like that, use vias and thoughtful crossings to connect D0/D1 to the USB chip and D11/12/13 to the ICSP header. However try to minimize the length of traces on the back, because of the [ground plane](#Ground%20Plane) we will later put in.\n\n\n### The other tracks\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/3631.webp)\n\nAnd then you can run the Reset track.\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/3732.webp)\n\nAnd VCC.\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/3833.webp)\n\nAnd then a little bit of finagling with the A6, A7, and D13 vias lets us run VBUS under the Microcontroller, straight up to the USB port.\n\nNow, we only have ground pins left, and for that, we'll do something special.\n\n### Ground Plane\n\nA ground plane is a large continuous chunk of copper on a layer. It creates a low impedance i.e. clean and easy path for ground current to return. (Because physics) Having an adjacent ground plane also reduces the interference between parallel traces.  More complex 4 layer boards might even have a plane for VCC power. In this board, the ground plane will take up all the unoccupied space on the `B.Cu` layer.\n\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/3934.webp)\n\nFirst, click on 'Add a filled zone'.\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/4035.webp)\n\nThen, click on a point far outside the edge of the board and set up the Copper Zone to be connected to ground, and to remove islands below 10mm^2.\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/4136.webp)\n\nThen, draw a shape encompassing the whole board and press 'B' to build the plane.\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/4237.webp)\n\nYou should play with Zone opacity in the Objects sidebar to find something good for you.\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/4338.webp)\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/4439.webp)\n\nThen, start dropping vias from ground pads. Press escape when it draws a blue trace, you only need the via here.\n\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/4640.webp)\n\nThe through-holes should connect themselves to the ground plane.\nThis is what all the grounds look like.\n\n\n## (Optional) Header Pins\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\n\u003csummary\u003eIf you want your PCB manufacturer to install Arduino Header Pins on your board.\u003c/summary\u003e\n\nThis could be useful if you want to mount your board onto a breadboard but don't have soldering equipment.\n\nGo back to your schematic and add these two `Conn_01x15_Pin` symbols and connect them to the correct nets.\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/5653.webp)\n\n\u003e Note how D0/D1 are flipped relative to the rest of the pins.\n\nIn the footprint selection window, select `PinHeader_1x15_P2.54mm_Vertical` for both.\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/5754.webp)\n\nUpdate your board to sync it with the schematic and then position the new pins on top of the old ones.\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/5855.webp)\nYou might have to zoom in to get the holes perfectly concentric.\n\nLock the new pins in place (Right Click \u003e Locking \u003e Lock) and delete the old Arduino layout.\n\nAdditionally, you might want to add pin labels on the back silkscreen layer (where there is more space).\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n## Design Rules Checker\n\n\u003e Note: This section will vary a lot for you based on your design and layout.\n\nThe Design Rules Checker (DRC) looks at the constraints we set the board up with and finds problems in the design.\n\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/4741.webp)\n\nAfter you run the DRC with Refilling and Parity checks, you should see a bunch of errors.\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/4842.webp)\n\nSooo, there's 90 issues. That's not good. Luckily, the vast majority of them are inconsequential.\n\nThe most important issues are in the Unconnected Items tab:\n\n- All 3 unconnected SHIELD errors can be Right Click \u003e Excluded. Microcontrollers and complex ICs might have multiple pins that serve the same function, so KiCAD expects identically named pins to be interconnected. In this case, it's meaningless and can be ignored because it's just the USB housing.\n- GND on the ICSP header is disconnected. That's a big problem.\n\n\u003e Note: while this solution is presented straightforwardly - coming up with it really wasn't. I spent way more than 30 mins comparing approaches before I decided on this. \n\n\nTurned out, the part of the ground plane that connected to this GND pin was disconnected from the rest [^2], so make it like this:\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/4944.webp)\n\nThe ground plane island highlighted another issue with this design. If you follow the current flow from the USB port to the bottom plane, it turns out the whole thing relies on one .3mm connection under the clock.\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/5045.webp)\n\nFortunately, there's an easy solution: double-click the ground plane to open properties and change its clearance and minimum width to .3mm.\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/5146.webp)\n\nThen, the ground plane goes in between the planes and it's a continuous chunk again.\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/5247.webp)\n\nAnd now our board is electrically done!\n\nYou can solve other DRC issues pretty easily.\n- For trace clearance issues, just move the trace away from the specified component. These sometimes pop up when rearranging components.\n- You can ignore/exclude all the Courtyard Overlaps with A1. That just points out that there are components inside the Arduino template [^3].\n- Through-hole has 'Thermal relief connection incomplete': if the connection looks good enough, it's good enough.\n- Ignore most 'Footprint doesn't match copy' and Silkscreen warnings. Manually fix the silkscreens that you want to see.\n\n\n## Finished Board\n![](https://cloud-596d7k8lu-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/11longhorn_leds-brd.svg)\n![](https://cloud-1tut81n9o-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0longhorn_leds-B_Cu.svg)\n\n![](https://cloud-r3x168b9x-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/5552.webp)\n\n{/* will automatically have footnotes header */}\n[^1]: More info at https://eepower.com/resistor-guide/resistor-standards-and-codes/resistor-sizes-and-packages/#\n      Also, we're only using 0805 in Part 2, not Part 3.\n\n[^2]: Ideally, the ground plane would be a continuous, mostly unobstructed chunk, but that would require either spreading out the components or more layers. Both would result in more complexity and cost, which is not good for this workshop.\n\n[^3]: If you're obsessed with details like me and want to fix it, right-click A1 \u003e Open in Footprint Editor; delete the purple courtyard. This only affects this one instance of the Arduino footprint, and won't affect future PCBs you make with KiCAD. This tells KiCAD that the Arduino is not an exclusive component, and other things can overlap it.\n\n[^4]: Tips in prerequisites by [@camdan.me](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U04J96SRS5B).\n\n"

Because we're adding a lot of complicated components here, this could be a litle confusing. Especially for the terminology, Google is your friend. If you're confused about any concepts, asking questions on Slack is highly encouraged, we all learn better together! Asking questions will also help me make this jam better for future jammers.\n\n   \u003cAnnouncement\n            copy=\"This Jam is in Beta\"\n            caption=\"We need your help and feedback on the clarity of this jam.\"\n            href=\"https://github.com/hackclub/jams/blob/main/jams/batches/sparkletilt-pcb/part-3/en-US.md\"\n            iconLeft=\"help\"\n            color=\"primary\"\n          /\u003e\n\n## Part selection\n\n1. Battery Charger - TP4057 - It's a basic part on JLCPCB, fairly small (SOT-23), and has two separate LEDs for charging and battery full.\n2. LEDs - WS2812 or SK6812 - There are several addressable options in the WS2812 and SK6812 series. Most of them are rated for 3.7V-5.3V and require 70% of VDD to read a logic high. Your main deciding factor here will be physical and assembly constraints. In my design, I wanted the LEDs on the opposite side of the rest of the circuit which further increased complications (getting both sides assembled is super expensive). \n   \n    I ended up installing a combination of the `SK6812SIDE-A-RVS` which shines at a right angle from JLCPCB, and the `WS2812D-F5` for the back of my board, that I could solder myself[^13]. Honorable mentions go to the `SK6812MINI-E`, a reverse-mounted LED that I would've totally used if my board was wide enough. There is no right answer here; everyone's design and aesthetic preferences will differ.\n3. Accelerometer - LIS3DHTR - We don't need anything too fancy as we're just measuring the orientation of 1G relative to the board. Unfortunately, there are no popular and cheap 5V-compatible accelerometers. The LIS3DHTR is 1.8V to 3.6V and Arduino libraries from Adafruit and Sparkfun exist for it.\n\n\n\n### The voltage dilemma\n\nNow you might be noticing a problem. The accelerometer wants 1.8V - 3.6V, while the LED wants to be driven at 3.7V - 5.3V, and wants 70% of its driving voltage for signals. \nAdding to the confusion, Li-ion batteries run from 4.2V to 3.5V (for 80% discharge)[^1].\n\nSo we need a voltage regulator for the accelerometer, which leaves us with two options:\n1. We can level shift between the microcontroller and accelerometer.\n2. Run the microcontroller, USB chip, and accelerometer at 3.3V, and level shift to the LEDs.\n\nWith option 2, what do we need to shift? If we keep driving the LEDs at 5V, they need 70% of 5V = 3.5V to (officially[^2]) count a logic high. \n**Neat hack #1**: However, if we drop the LED's voltage by .5V or more (4.5V * 70% = 3.15V), we will be in spec. It can be lower, just not higher.\n\nSo, to sum up, we want the LEDs driven at 4.5V or less, and the microcontroller and chips to be at 3.3V.\n\nSo, our power net requirements:\n\n1. USB_P - 4.75V - 5.25V. Raw USB.\n2. VBAT - 3.0V - 4.2V. Current should only go into this through the charger, and it's connected to VDrive if and only if USB is unplugged. Connecting a Lithium Battery directly to 5V would be a recipe for disaster[^3].\n3. VBUS - slightly under 5V. USB with just one diode to prevent reverse current flow.\n4. VDrive - 3.5V (battery min) to 4.5V (USB Max). This will power the LEDs, smartly switching over to the batteries when USB is unplugged.\n5. VCC - 3.3V. Regulated, stable power for the microcontroller, accelerometer, and USB chip.\n\nThis may seem very complicated, but it'll be clear once we start working on the schematics.\n\n---\n\nThe rest of the parts are:\n\n4. Voltage Regulator - XC6206P332MR. A small (SOT-23) basic LDO (Low DropOut) voltage regulator on JLCPCB Basic Parts that outputs 3.3V. This has a 250mV dropout, so it needs 3.55V in to output 3.3V, and it can take in up to 6V.\n5. Switches - C40737. Just a nice small DIP switch[^4] to set different modes on our MCU.\n5. P-Channel MOSFET - AO3401A. This will switch the battery onto VDrive when USB is disconnected. Same story, the best of the three available basic parts of JLCPCB; adequate current capacity and low resistance.\n6. Diodes - C8678. So, we want to drop our ~5V USB input to `\u003c4.5V`. While they are not perfectly linear like Ohmic resistors, diodes do vary the voltage they drop based on the current going through them. To stay in spec with both the LDO and the LEDs, we want the lowest voltage on VDrive to be `\u003e3.7V`. So, our drop ranges from .5V to 1.3V (varying based on current draw). We will use two diodes (explained later), so each should have a current drop between 0.25V to 0.65V. This SS34 Diode fits the bill and can dissipate all that heat.\n\n## Modifications\n\nThere are 3 modifications you need to make to the old design to suit the new power layout.\n\n1. Connect the new power rails to the right pins.  \n   ![](https://cloud-rbtn9ts6c-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/192.webp)\n2. The USB chip now runs off 3.3V VCC, and according to [the datasheet](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Dev/Arduino/Other/CH340DS1.PDF), V3 and VCC need to be connected together to 3.3V. Also, lower the resistance for the LEDs because of the lower voltage. ![](https://cloud-rbtn9ts6c-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/233.webp)\n3. Change the Diode to our new one, and USB is now powering VBUS and USB_P (5V rail). ![](https://cloud-rbtn9ts6c-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/244.webp)\n\n\n## Other peripherals\n\nFirst, create a new sheet called \"Devices\" to store everything else and place it on your schematic.\n\n![](https://cloud-rbtn9ts6c-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/255.webp)\n\nNow, you have a whole new page to store your components.\n\n### Accelerometer\n\nIn 'Section 4: Application Hints' of the [LIS3DH datasheet](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/lis3dh.pdf), you'll see an example circuit and descriptions for what you're supposed to do to each pin. You can also look at other OSHW circuits (ex. Adafruit, Sparkfun) to understand the application of such an IC.\n\n![](https://cloud-rbtn9ts6c-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/266.webp)\n\nHere, everything is powered from the 3.3V VCC. There are two decoupling capacitors (100nF and 10uF) as required by the datasheet. The two 4.7K resistors pull the I2C line high when it's not being used. CS is tied high to enable I2C communication at all times. The interrupts are not being used here since we don't need data immediately[^5].\n\n### Configuration Switch\n\nThis is a simple set of switches that can be read with the microcontroller's internal pullup pins and will let us define aspects of the LEDs and Level in software. Consider using something that has protruding switches and is (significantly) bigger than the C40737 if you want to control it by hand.\n\n![](https://cloud-rbtn9ts6c-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/277.webp)\n\n### Battery Charging\n\n[The datasheet](https://cloud-b6v3rkn29-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1tp4057-google-translated-datasheet.pdf) for the TP4057 recommends this circuit if we want the Red LED to light up when it's charging, the Green LED when it's charged, and both lights off if no battery is connected.\n\n![](https://cloud-rbtn9ts6c-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/010.webp)\n\nThe PROG resistor determines how fast to charge the battery based on a formula, some common values are in the datasheet:\n\n![](https://cloud-rbtn9ts6c-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/299.webp)\n\nLithium batteries should typically only be charged with up to 1C of current[^8]. For example, if you have a 300mAh battery, 1C = 300mA of charge or discharge current. Since this is an LED project, it'll require big batteries (\u003e 500mAh), so we'll select 500mA as the charging current with a 1.6k resistor[^7].\n\nThis is the final schematic:\n![](https://cloud-rbtn9ts6c-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/288.webp)\n\n\n### Power Processing\n\n![](https://cloud-rbtn9ts6c-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/212.webp)\n\n\u003e KiCAD doesn't have a TP4057 symbol by default, see the [Component Listing](#Component%20Listing) to download it.\n\nAs covered in [the voltage dilemma](#The%20Voltage%20Dilemma), we need several voltage rails for different applications.\n\nThe accelerometer, USB interface, and microcontroller all run off of 3.3V VCC from the voltage regulator.\n\nThe voltage regulator and LEDs are powered from VDrive, which may be powered by VBUS or VBat[^9].\n\nThe battery charger runs exclusively off of VBUS.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\n\u003csummary\u003eHow does the MOSFET switch VBat onto VDrive?\u003c/summary\u003e\n\nThis is called a Power ORing circuit.\n\nSo, I have a battery (say +3V min) and USB (nominally +5V). I want to drive VDrive from the USB when it's connected, else the battery. This is the simplest way to do that:\n\n![](https://cloud-rbtn9ts6c-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/314.webp)\n\nHere, the VBat Diode has one job: Protect the battery from charging directly through USB. This is because when VDrive (the junction point) is at 5V due to USB (maybe 4.6V due to the diodes), the potential at VDrive is higher than the potential at VBat. Since current flows from higher to lower potential (voltage), it won't flow from the battery (`\u003c4.2V`) to VDrive (`\u003e4.5V`). The diode (being a one-way valve) won't allow USB current into the battery.\n\nThe VBUS Diode prevents the battery from powering the charger, possible power LEDs or any other USB-only components.\n\nNow, why is our MOSFET design better? It seems far more complicated. But, the trick is that instead of a fixed voltage drop, turning the MOSFET on causes the drop to be ~40 mOhms. At 1A, that is a .04V drop - significantly better than the diode's ~.3V. Not only does this save energy, it allows you to use the battery down to a lower voltage.\n\n![](https://cloud-rbtn9ts6c-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/415.webp)\n\nThere are 3 states to this MOSFET arrangement[^10]:\n1. VBUS is 5V, VBAT is 4V. `(G - S) \u003e -1`. MOSFET does not conduct. Additionally, since `S \u003e D`, no potential gets applied backward onto the battery.\n2. VBUS is 0V (stable because of the pull-down), VBAT (D) is 4V. G = S = 0. Now, since `S \u003c D`, current can flow across the body diode. This brings S up to 3V.\n3. Now, S = 3V, G = 0V, `(G - S) \u003c -1V` and the MOSFET is enabled.\n4. If VUSB is enabled again now, go back to step 1.\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\nAdditionally, the USB interface should already be protected in case VBUS is powered by the header pin.\n\n![](https://cloud-rbtn9ts6c-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/244.webp)\n\nThis design is why current coming from USB to VDrive has two diodes, and thus we picked diodes with a 0.25V to 0.65V drop (ideally a constant .3V). \n\n### LEDs\n\nThis is a chain of NeoPixels:\n\n![](https://cloud-rbtn9ts6c-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/516.webp)\n\nThe WS2812B symbol works for any WS2812 or SK6812 LED that has 4 pins (+, -, DIN, DOUT). Since they are all logically the same, different NeoPixel form factors use the same symbol with different PCB footprints. Although they are not required, we have a capacitor to aid with sudden bursts of energy and a resistor to stop too much current from going to the LED's data pin in case of a short[^11]. There's also a debug connector to test the LEDs from an external microcontroller, again, not required, just helpful in development.\n\nAs I said in Part Selection, your NeoPixel choice will vary hugely based on your physical design and assembly technique. Feel free to ask for help in [#onboard-help](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C0593MG26TT) on Slack.\n\n\u003e Note: Each Neopixel uses up to 60mA at max brightness. While this circuit is prepared to deal with 3A, make sure your power supply and battery are too. Even though you may not be planning to set them to full birghtness (because they are insanely bright), don't go way over the limit (50 LEDs) so software bugs or electrical glitches don't burn your house down.\n\u003e Your battery MUST be at least 1000mAh (ideally more) if you have 50 LEDs = 3A. This will prevent it from triggering its overcurrent protection in case of accidental max brightness. If you're *planning* to run 50 LEDs at max brightness, I'd recommend going with at least 3000mAh battery to discharge at 1C[^12].\n\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eHow to group LEDs?\u003c/summary\u003e\n\nFrom a circuit standpoint, putting LEDs in parallel is easy: you just connect their DIN pins and leave out all but one of their DOUTs.\n\n\u003e **Note**: Carefully compare the datasheets if you're putting two different LEDs in parallel. Some LEDs are GRB, others are RGB, so won't be the same color if connected in parallel[^13].\n\n![](https://cloud-rbtn9ts6c-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1122.webp)\n\nBut, as you can see, it quickly turns into a mess. If you want to block sets of LEDs that will be together repeatedly (in series or in parallel) do this:\n\nFirst, add a hierarchical sheet called `LED_BLOCK`. Then, put something like this in it (for parallel). Since the power symbols are globally the same, you can put them inside this drawing rather than having to connect it to every single LED group.\n![](https://cloud-rbtn9ts6c-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/617.webp)\n\nThen, add hierarchical labels from the right sidebar called \"DIN\" and \"DOUT\".\n\n![](https://cloud-rbtn9ts6c-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/718.webp)\n\nThen, connect them to the right points. Notice how we're not connecting both the LEDs outputs; they would interfere with each other. One LED is doing the talking on DOUT, while the other is a passive listener.\n![](https://cloud-rbtn9ts6c-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/819.webp)\n\nGo back to the DEVICES sheet. Then, click on 'Import a hierarchical sheet pin' to put the DIN and DOUT we defined in the last step to the outside of the block. You can delete the 'File' label.\n![](https://cloud-rbtn9ts6c-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/920.webp)\n\nThen, copy-paste this sheet and connect it in a chain.\n![](https://cloud-rbtn9ts6c-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1021.webp)\n\nIf you copy and paste them, the blocks will be linked and making a change to one will propagate throughout the rest, making iteration easier.\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n## Component Listing\n\nTo add symbols, see the [CH340N from Part 1](./part-1#USB%20Interface). Just like that, in the PCB view, you can add custom footprint libraries. My custom symbols (TP4057) and footprints (LEDs) are in [custom-leds.pretty.zip](https://cloud-b6v3rkn29-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/2custom-leds.pretty.zip), which you need can extract into your KiCAD project folder. You could also find such footprints elsewhere on the internet, or create them from the datasheet.\n\n![](https://cloud-rbtn9ts6c-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/2131.webp)\n![](https://cloud-rbtn9ts6c-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/2232.webp)\n\n\n\n| Name                                                       | Footprint              | LCSC Number | Reasoning                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------- | --- |\n| TP4057                                                     | TSOT-23-6              | C12044      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Battery Cell (Connector, not actual batery)                | jst ph-k 1x02 vertical | C131337     | You can also pick SMD connectors to trade a bit of strength for a clean back surface                                                                                                                                                |\n| 100uF Capacitor                                            | 1206                   | C15008      | Such a big capacitor is only available in 1206                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Resistors/Capacitors around battery charger, accelerometer | 0402                   |             | I tend to avoid tiny components because they're difficult to rework in case of an error, but these chips have such small pin spacing that it's only convinient to use matching components + I was running out of space on my board |\n| Power Diode                                                | SMA                    | C8678       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| DIP Switch                                                 | x06 1.27 7.62 kingtek  | C40737      | Matched w/ datasheet of chip                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| SK6812SIDE                                                 | SK6812-SIDE            | C2890037    | Custom made footprint, download above                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| WS2812D-F5                                                 | WS2812 F5              | C5149201    | same                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| AO3401A                                                    | SOT-23                 | C15127      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n\n## PCB Design\n\nSince your board design will be very different from mine - with a different physical shape, perhaps even different components, the following images are just for inspiration. Try arranging the components yourself.\n\n\nI replaced the one big diode with the accelerometer near the MCU, to make routing easier, since they both talk I2C and use 3.3V VCC. It's using 0402 components and .2mm traces to reasonably be able to route around the incredibly tiny pins.\n\n![](https://cloud-596d7k8lu-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1123.png)\n![](https://cloud-rbtn9ts6c-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1425.webp)\n\nI also put the voltage regulator in that vicinity because everything that needs 3.3V VCC is inside the Arduino footprint.\n![](https://cloud-rbtn9ts6c-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1324.webp)\n\nThe two power diodes are off to one side, where I found some free space. That header pin is the only thing connected to VBUS, so centering the diodes approximately there reduces trace length.\n\n![](https://cloud-rbtn9ts6c-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1526.webp)\n![](https://cloud-rbtn9ts6c-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1627.webp)\n\n\nThen, the battery charger and connector are placed right next to the rest of the power management. \n\n\u003e I'd recommend flipping the connector compared to how I placed it in the image because the ICSP header is obstructing my clips.\n![](https://cloud-rbtn9ts6c-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1728.webp)\n\nThe switch is oriented (and wired in the schematic) in such a way that the switch pads and header pins are in a line.\n\n![](https://cloud-rbtn9ts6c-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1829.webp)\n\nAnd my overly complicated parallel LEDs were laid out as shown. Of course, you can't use both at the same time due to color encoding differences (see the [LEDs section on grouping](#LEDs)). The through-holes provide a free via to run VDrive on the other side and access the ground plane. If you have a peninsula like this, double-check that the ground plane isn't constricted through a bottleneck. There's no harm in running traces on top of the plane to ensure there's enough capacity.\n![](https://cloud-rbtn9ts6c-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/2030.webp)\n\n\n## Final Design\nAnd that's it, you have a completed SparkleTilt!\nFull Board:\n![](https://cloud-596d7k8lu-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/6longhorn_leds-F_Cu.svg)\n![](https://cloud-596d7k8lu-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/2longhorn_leds-B_Cu.svg)\n![](https://cloud-596d7k8lu-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/7longhorn_leds-F_Fab.svg)\n![](https://cloud-596d7k8lu-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/3longhorn_leds-brd.svg)\n\nThis is the full schematic:\n![](https://cloud-596d7k8lu-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/8longhorn_leds.svg)\n![](https://cloud-596d7k8lu-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/5longhorn_leds-DEVICES_PAGE.svg)\n![](https://cloud-596d7k8lu-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/4longhorn_leds-DEVICES_PAGE-LED-stick0.svg)\n\nThis is what my board looks like (the CH340N is missing because I messed up the traces in v1):\n![](https://cloud-izep2lpej-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/031picture.jpg)\n\nI can't wait to see how you remix this. You can share your designs and get feedback in [#onboard on Slack](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C056AMWSFKJ). We'll discuss programming this board in Part 5 of this jam! (Coming Soon)\n\n{/* the markdown renderer for GFM ought to automatically add a \"Footnotes\" header right around here */}\n[^1]: https://learn.adafruit.com/li-ion-and-lipoly-batteries/voltages\n[^2]: In practice, you may see Neopixels running happily from 3.3V microcontrollers, but can't rely on that. The MCU's voltage might be on the lower end and output slightly under 3.3V, your USB line might be outputting 5.2V and now the limit is at 3.65V, etc. It's best to keep a margin of error.\n[^3]: https://youtu.be/osfgkFyq7lA?t=127\n[^4]: A DIP switch is a package with multiple individual switches like this: \u003cimg src=\"https://cloud-rbtn9ts6c-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/301.jpg\" width=\"50%\" /\u003e\n[^5]: These interrupts would be useful if you needed an event notification from the IC (is acceleration \u003e *n*?), or you wanted every single value immediately after it was measured (integrate acceleration to velocity) (AKA Pushing data). In our case, we'll just ask the chip for the acceleration every few hundred milliseconds (AKA Polling data).\n[^6]: See table on page 8 for more info.\n[^7]: I used 1.5k because 1.6ks were unavailable in my size on JLCPCB, anything around that ought to work. Similarly, I used a 4.7k instead of a 5k on the battery pin pull-up.\n[^8]: Slower charging is fine, it'll just take more time, whereas faster could overheat the battery, reducing capacity.\n[^9]: This ORing design was inspired by [Unexpected Maker's Feather S3](https://github.com/UnexpectedMaker/esp32s3/blob/4aa7ebb8e56a60362dc5455193b5c223e020a28b/schematics/schematic-feathers3_p7.pdf). Open Source Hardware FTW!\n[^10]: This video on reverse voltage protection might help understand these states: [YouTube](https://youtu.be/IrB-FPcv1Dc?t=116). We are doing practically the same thing, just checking another power supply instead of the direction of the one battery.\n[^11]: It's unlikely to have a disconnected power supply but active data pin on a PCB, but the cost of adding the resistor is negligible, so might as well. It's not a big deal if you remove it.\n[^12]: https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/466498/344964 \n[^13]: You can't connect the SK6812SIDE-A-RVS and WS2812D-F5 in parallel, because the data encoding for one is RGB, the other is GRB. I learned that the hard way."

ESP32s and RP2040s typically work out of the box.\n\n## Install the Extension\n\nClick on Plugin Manager on the KiCAD home page.\n\n![](https://cloud-9ctvo6cbs-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/111.webp)\n\nSearch for 'JLC'.\n\n![](https://cloud-9ctvo6cbs-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/122.webp)\n\nInstall 'Fabrication Toolkit' and apply changes.\n\n\n## Assign Part Numbers\n\nOpen your schematic. Go to Bulk Edit fields.\n\n![](https://cloud-9ctvo6cbs-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/135.webp)\n\nIn the Field Editor window, click on 'Add Field' and add the field `LCSC`. It doesn't matter whether you have `Sim.*` or `Datasheet` fields or not.\n\n![](https://cloud-9ctvo6cbs-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/146.webp)\n\nThen, search for your components at [jlcpcb.com/parts](https://jlcpcb.com/parts) and fill in the LCSC id.\n\nFor generic components, search for the Value and Footprint - `100nF 0805` - and check basic parts. You'll see a couple of different voltages, pick the lower (cheaper) one since we are only at 5V.\n\nYou don't *have* to necessarily specify the part number for generic components like 0805 resistors or capacitors, but I prefer to manually select it rather than leave it up to JLCPCB to decide.\n\nThe LCSC Part number (aka JLCPCB Part #) looks like `Cxxxx`.\n\n![](https://cloud-9ctvo6cbs-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/157.webp)\n\nFor more specific components, like the Atmega328P-AU, you should only have a couple of options and just pick the most popular one (Basic Part if possible).\n\n![](https://cloud-9ctvo6cbs-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/168.webp)\n\n\nTry doing this yourself before you look at my version below.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\n\u003csummary\u003eThis is what your table should look like, and then Apply and Save.\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n![](https://cloud-9ctvo6cbs-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/179.webp)\n\nBecause A1 and J2 aren't real components - we only need their footprint and pin layout, not the component itself - they don't need an LCSC part number.\n\u003c/details\u003e\n  \n## Export files\n\nNow, go back to the PCB view and sync it.\n\n![](https://cloud-9ctvo6cbs-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/110.webp)\n\nThen, click on Tools \u003e External Plugins \u003e Fabrication Toolkit.\n\n\n![](https://cloud-9ctvo6cbs-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/211.webp)\n\nEverything you need to order your board will now be in `your_kicad_project/production/`.\n\n![](https://cloud-9ctvo6cbs-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/312.webp)\n\nNow, log in to [jlcpcb.com](https://jlcpcb.com). Go to [cart.jlcpcb.com/quote](https://cart.jlcpcb.com/quote) and upload `gerber.zip` into \"Add Gerber file\".\n\nYou should see something like this:\n![](https://cloud-9ctvo6cbs-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/413.webp)\n\nTips:\n- 5 is the minimum number of PCBs you can order.\n- You can change your shipping option on the right 'Shipping Estimate' sidebar.\n- Sometimes, reducing the PCB thickness from 1.6 to ~1.0 will reduce the weight of the package, and thus the shipping price without increasing manufacturing price.\n- If your PCB will be handled a lot consider selecting 'LeadFree HASL' for its surface; excessive exposure to lead can be toxic.\n\nLeave the 'High-spec options' at their defaults, and then, enable assembly. \n- You can choose to only assemble 2 boards out of 5, in which case the other 3 bare boards will be shipped to you. If you only want one PCB, this can save money on parts.\n- You can only assemble one side in Economic PCB assembly.\n- Standard PCB assembly with both sides is very expensive  (~$65) and will use up most of your grant money. Try to design PCBs that have components on one side and don't use any 'Standard Only' components. Or, solder the other side by hand.\n\n\n![](https://cloud-9ctvo6cbs-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/514.webp)\nThen, on the Bill of Materials page, upload bom.csv and positions.csv from your production folder. \n\n![](https://cloud-9ctvo6cbs-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/716.webp)\n\n- You can save a lot of money on Extended Parts in the long run (if you plan on making many PCBs) by buying them directly and soldering them yourself [^1]. For example, basically every project has a USB-C connector and header pins, so it makes sense to buy a bunch yourself and avoid the $3 extended part fee every time you buy a board from JLCPCB.\n- Virtual Components (only used for their through holes) like the Arduino Nano and ICSP header can be ignored.\n\n![](https://cloud-9ctvo6cbs-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/817.webp)\nWhen it prompts you about unselected parts, just click 'Do not place'.\n\nZoom into your components on the 'Component Placements' screen and rotate them to the correct orientation if they're wrong.\n\nIf you get all parts assembled, this board (from part 2)[^4] ends up being around $33.\n\n![](https://cloud-9ctvo6cbs-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/918.webp)\n\nWith shipping, that's $45 for me.\n\n![](https://cloud-9ctvo6cbs-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1019.webp)\n\n[^1]: You might want to edit the footprints of components you are hand-soldering. For example, to hand solder the USB-C connector, make the pads longer and remove unused ones like SBUS.\n[^2]: There are a million different ways to export your files and order with different manufacturers, but for simplicity, this jam only focuses on one.\n[^3]: by [@camdan.me](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U04J96SRS5B)\n[^4]: This is just the microcontroller board from parts 1 and 2. It does not include any of the peripherals such as th LEDs and accelerometer."

                      "content": "\nAt Hack Club we believe strongly that the best way to learn to code is by making creative, interesting, meaningful projects. Sprig is a project by Hack Club that enables anyone to do just that - we've created a web editor that both beginners and more advanced programmers can have fun making games in, and an accompanying handheld console that you can get for free by publishing your own game!\n\nBy the end of today's session, we'll be making our first project in Sprig: a [Sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban)-style push block game!\n\n### Outline:\n1. What's Sprig?\n2. Let's explore the Sprig editor!\n3. Build Your First Game!\n4. Wrap-up!\n\n## 1. What's Sprig?\n\n![](https://sprig.hackclub.com/stories-tiny/sprig-front.jpeg)\n\nSprig is a game editor, game engine and handheld gaming console all built by Hack Club. To learn more about how these were made, take a look at [Sprig's GitHub](https://github.com/hackclub/sprig)!\n\n### What level of programming is required to make Sprig games?\n\nYou will be learning and using JavaScript, and no previous experience with it is required. These are some examples of two games made by beginners:\n1. [Lava and Water](https://sprig.hackclub.com/gallery/Lava_and_Water) by Akeel\n2. [QuadraPedal](https://sprig.hackclub.com/gallery/QuadraPedal) by Jamarkis\n\nFor those of you with more JS experience, designing and building games can stretch and challenge your skills. Check out these games that really push what Sprig can do:\n1. [Raycasting](https://sprig.hackclub.com/gallery/raycasting) by Henry\n2. [Chess](https://sprig.hackclub.com/gallery/chess) by Thomas\n\nThere are hundreds more games in the [Sprig Gallery](https://sprig.hackclub.com/gallery), made by other teenagers, to learn from and take inspiration from!\n\n### Why should I bother with Sprig?\nSprig is an awesome tool to get started in programming! Sprig uses the [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) programming language, which is one of the most popular in the world. By coding games in Sprig, you'll get familiar with the language used to code many of the world's websites, apps, and games. Additionally, many of the concepts you'll learn are applicable to all of programming.\n\nBy completing your own game in Sprig, you'll also qualify to receive a [Sprig Console](https://github.com/hackclub/sprig-hardware); it's a DIY kit to make a handheld console, and it can run any Sprig game you build on a computer! \n\n## 2. Let’s explore the world of Sprig\n\n\u003cvideo src=\"https://cloud-qrfzzm21i-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0untitled.mp4\" controls=\"controls\" style={{maxWidth: \"720px\"}}\u003e\u003c/video\u003e\n\nThis video shows you around the world of sprig.\n\nStart your adventure here https://sprig.hackclub.com/  \nFrom there, check out the gallery of games submitted by teenagers from all over the world. https://sprig.hackclub.com/gallery\n\nNote that you can open any game in the gallery to see its code. In fact, this is a great way to learn coding– see how other hackers solved their game design problems!  \nTry clicking on one now!\n\nYou’re now in the Sprig code editor! Hitting the RUN button runs the current code, and allows you to play the game.  \nFun hint: the size of your editor and play window can be adjusted.\n\n\n### Make sure you don't lose your progress\n\nYou'll want to register with Sprig to save your work! Otherwise, logging out of your computer could clear your work (this is not fun!!).\n\nIn the login page, enter your email. A login code will be sent.\n\n![](https://cloud-2pdfjcqvn-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0log_in___sprig.png)\n\nUse the code sent to you to log in (can't find it... check spam folders?).\n\n![](https://cloud-hpv87yyem-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0your_games___sprig.png)\n\nCongrats! You’re now logged in. To access your saved games, use the same email to log in.\n\n## 3. Build Your First Game!\nClick on the gallery up top.\n\n![](https://cloud-1f122cf0k-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0gallery___sprig.png)\n\nWe’ll be following the getting_started tutorial. Click it.\n\n![](https://cloud-pcjfwllpn-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0getting_started___sprig.png)\n\nIn the HELP screen there are both a TOOLKIT of functions particular to Sprig, and a TUTORIAL for “Getting_Started.” Follow the instructions there to build your first Sokobon Puzzle!\n\nClick the \"remix\" button in the top right corner, so that your changes will be saved.\n\n## 4. Wrap-up!\nCongratulations! By finishing this session, you just made your first game in Sprig!  \n\n![](https://cloud-4ja9fp00s-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\nNext session and for the next 2 sessions, we’ll be building on our knowledge and creating a maze game from scratch.

Collaboration and interaction is what makes meetings fun and keeps people coming back.  \nHere's some ideas to encourage this:\n- Encourage people to ask the people around them from help as a first resort!\n- Have everyone design sprites, then pair up with someone else who creates a story and game around it\n\n## Get Started\nLast session, you built a push block game in Sprig (if you haven't, check out [part 1](/batch/sprig/part-1) of this jam!). Let's build off that experience and make something even more awesome!\n\n![](https://cloud-ctbvwlpse-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0sprig.gif)\n*This is a sample of what your base game might look like! I made mine about a watering can who needs to get to a flower, but your game's story, levels, sprites, etc. will be your very own :)*\n\nToday, we'll be learning to make a maze game in Sprig! By the end of this jam, you'll have created your very own maze game from scratch! Next session we'll be adding custom game mechanics and getting ready to share your game with the world! (how exciting is that??)\n\nThe tutorial includes hidden hints that you can use if you need. Try your best to work through the challenges using your resources (using the Sprig help, Google, and asking the people around you is all encouraged!) but don't be afraid to use the hints if you need to.\n\n[Click here](https://sprig-nocode.hackclub.dev/maze) for a demo of what you could make today.\n\nImportant note: If you’re interested in getting a free Sprig game console for a Game submission, you’ll need to make unique gameplay mechanics beyond the scope of this tutorial (click [here](https://github.com/hackclub/sprig/blob/main/docs/GET_A_SPRIG.md) for the criteria to get a console). We suggest expanding this game to make it more original, or creating a new one once you’ve learned the basics here!\n\n## Brainstorming \u0026 sketching\nLet's think about how you can make your game unique while following this tutorial! After you take a look at the [demo](https://sprig-nocode.hackclub.dev/maze), take a few minutes with a piece of paper and make some sketches for what your game's characters and objects could look like, what kind of story/theme could be crafted around them, and how you can make your own maze game that is unique to you.\n\n## Starting the tutorial\nLet's head to [this page](https://sprig.hackclub.com/gallery/maze_game_starter) and get started with the tutorial! It's in the bottom right corner, just like the getting started tutorial was in session 1. Make sure to click the \"Remix\" button in the top right corner so your code changes will be saved.\n\n## Wrap-up!\nCongratulations!!

See the [Schematic](https://cloud-1we5i4we0-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1schematic_schematic-usb-hub-2-port-jam_2023-08-10.pdf) and the [EasyEDA source](https://cloud-1we5i4we0-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0sch_schematic-usb-hub-2-port-jam_2023-08-10.json)._\n\n# Putting the \"scheme\" in schematic\n\n![](https://cloud-j8bxr01tm-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1usb_hub_needed.png)\n\n_Has this ever happened to you? You really need a USB hub!_\n\nToday we're going to make a USB splitter. It'll have 1 USB-A on one side, and 2 USB-A ports on the other side. It can transmit power as well as data.\n\nWe're starting with a schematic. They're like the blueprint for a PCB. It's a good way to figure out what's connected to what before you actually lay out the parts on your board.\n\n![](https://cloud-6d6aarot8-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0schematic_to_pcb.png)\n\n\u003e Schematics correspond to the parts of your PCB.\n\n## Start a new project\n\nGo to [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/editor) and create a new project (File \u003e New \u003e Project...). Name it `usb-hub`.\n\n## Add the parts\n\nFor our design, we're going to need a USB-A connector that plugs into our computer. Click the `Libraries` button on the left toolbar, and search for `C98125`.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-07-14 022430](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52e27925-0a72-4a68-a602-4311b9e291ee)\n\nOnce you select it, click the `Place` button to add the part to our project. It might look a little different than the images in this tutorial, but that's okay.\n\n![](https://cloud-b1al1d09c-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/00screenshot_2023-08-08_at_12.20.04.png)\n\nYeah! You did it. Now let's add the other parts we'll need!\n\nWe'll need another USB-A connector, but this time a female connector for the devices we charge / plug in. Do another search for `usb-a`. A bunch of options will show up with options like price, stock, and mounting type. You won't understand all the options yet \u0026 \u003cb\u003ethat's ok\u003c/b\u003e! I ended up using part number [`C46407`](https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/USB-Connectors_Jing-Extension-of-the-Electronic-Co-903-131A1011D10100_C46407.html). This time, place 2 of them on the board.\n\nNext up we need a main board to connect everything together. There are a bunch out there, but I ended up using the CoreChips SL2.1A with part number [`C192893`](https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/USB-ICs_CoreChips-SL2-1A_C192893.html).\n\nNow that we've got a great big pile of parts in our sandbox, the next step is to connect them together!\n\n## Connect it together\n\nWe've got a whole list of parts to hook up now. Let's start with the USB-A male connector to the CoreChips SL2.1A. But what do we need to wire together?\n\n\u003ch2\u003e~~*Connect it together*~~ \u003cins\u003eRead the spec\u003c/ins\u003e!\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cdiv style={{display: \"none\"}}\u003e\n## Read the spec!\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nLet's find the spec for the CoreChips SL2.1A. A spec is kinda like a README for a part. Every part has one, and it's a great place to start when you're trying to figure out how to use a part.\n\nGo to [lcsc.com](https://lcsc.com) and search for `C192893`. Click on the part and scroll down to the `Datasheet` section. Click on the link to download the datasheet.\n\n_Just in case, [here's a link to the spec sheet for the SL2.1A](https://cloud-fa5e1sjdd-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/01811151645_corechips-sl2-1a_c192893.pdf)._\n\nNow let's open it up and just start reading through the table of contents to find where \u003ci\u003ewhoops\u003c/i\u003e wait it's all in Chinese.\n\n![](https://cloud-961a0s7fx-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-08-08_at_19.05.22.png)\n\nThat's fine! Many specs are in other languages and guessing/translating is part of the skill! The important part is in here, the list of pins and what they do. It looks like this:\n\n![](https://cloud-h587v4g5f-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-08-08_at_12.37.30.png)\n\nPrinted Circuit Board (PCB) part-makers really like to use acronymns, which are the same in every language! We can use the acronymns to figure out what the pins do. Here's a list of the ones we'll need:\n\n- VDD5: 5V power (also called VCC or VBUS)\n- GND: ground\n- DP: data positive (also called D+)\n- DM: data negative (also called D-)\n\nGreat, now we know what we need to do on the chip side, let's find the spec for the USB-A!\n\nThe part I chose also had a spec in chinese, but it's a common part so I found [this by googling \"USB-A pinout spec\"](https://components101.com/connectors/usb-type-a-male-connector). It's a bit different than our pin numbers, but the names are the same. The only difference is that our ports HM1 \u0026 HM2 are also `GND` ports. You don't need to know why right now, but for the curious, google \"grounded USB shield\".\n\n## Connect it together, for real this time!\n\nMove the parts around so they're facing eachother (you can rotate them with the `R` key), the go ahead and connect `GND` on the usb to `GND` on the chip.\n\n![](https://cloud-ntdzh89kj-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-08-08_at_12.48.41.png)\n\nNow you can connect `VCC` on the usb to `VDD5` on the chip. They aren't labelled the same thing, but `VCC` just means a voltage source, and USB-A is a 5V source.\n\nNext up, connect `D+` on the usb to `DP` on the chip, and `D-` on the usb to `DM` on the chip.\n\n![](https://cloud-72qwemi78-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-08-08_at_12.54.13.png)\n\nHmmmm, this is looking a little like a bowl of spaghetti. Let's clean it up with nets!\n\n![](https://cloud-j8bxr01tm-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/2spaghetti.png)\n\n### Nets\n\nNets are a way to group together wires that are connected to eachother. They're a great way to make your schematic look cleaner and easier to read. Go ahead and remove the VCC \u0026 GND lines, then choose the GND net from the toolbar on the right.\n\n![](https://cloud-m5x117vsl-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-08-08_at_12.56.40.png)\n\nConnect the GND net to the GND pins on the USB-A and the CoreChips SL2.1A. See how clean that new wiring is?\n\n![](https://cloud-7pzslk6qe-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-08-08_at_13.04.24.png)\n\nNets are kinda like portals– you can connect them from a distance as a way to keep from crossing your wires on your schematic. They're also good for connecting lots of things together– we're going to need to wire a lot of things to `GND` in a sec, and nets are a great way to do that.\n\nKeep in mind though with nets, there are a lot of ways to write things. All the following are a way to say PIN 4 and PIN 5 are connected to `GND`:\n\n![](https://cloud-d47mlqyh7-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0gnd_net_types.png)\n\nTo prevent mistakes, try to keep your nets looking like mine for this tutorial, but in general everyone has their own style and that's ok.\n\n![](https://cloud-j8bxr01tm-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0gnd_nets.png)\n\n## Ground the Shield\n\nGo ahead and connect MH1 \u0026 MH2 to GND also. These aren't really ports- they're just the parts where the metal cover of the USB sticks into the board. We'll connect them to ground in case there's any static electricity.\n\n![](https://cloud-7u8ahczmz-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-10-11_at_13.27.24.png)\n\n![](https://cloud-1vlpmdjo8-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-10-11_at_13.30.41.png)\n\n## Add the other USBs\n\nNext up let's connect the other USB-A connectors!\n\nI'll position my USB-A female ports and hook them up to the main chip's `DP` and `DM` pins. `DP1` goes to USB-1's `D+`. After getting the data lines wired, we'll connect the power using nets!\n\nOn these USBs, ports 5 \u0026 6 are the same as ports MH1 \u0026 MH2. They're just the metal shield, so we'll connect them to `GND` as well.\n\n![](https://cloud-6cwv1d324-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-08-08_at_15.16.16.png)\n\n_Remember, with nets you can connect from a distance!_\n\n## Power surges\n\nThe design is almost complete, and in a perfect world it would work just fine. But we aren't in a perfect world- we live in a world with static electricty and power surges. We'll need to now protect our circuit. If we don't, we could fry our hub or even our computer's USB port!\n\nKnowing where these protective components go can be an art and hotly debated on many stackoverflow forms. Fortunately, the spec sheets we're using contain some example circuits for us to use. Let's take a look at the CoreChips SL2.1A spec sheet again:\n\n![](https://cloud-a1u1u3jnb-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-08-08_at_17.32.45.png)\n\n_This is a little hard to see, so we'll go through it step by step. For now, just know we're getting the following instructions from reading this image \u0026 adapting it a little for our own design._\n\nFirst up we'll add a diode to protect from a surge coming _from the laptop_. That's a case where the laptop sends too much power and goes beyond the 5V we want. The Schottky (pronounced \"shot-key\") diode with part number [`C48192`](https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/Schottky-Barrier-Diodes-SBD_onsemi-NSR0320MW2T1G_C48192.html) is perfect for this. Let's drop it in right after we take on the 5V power from the USB-A male.\n\n_Diodes ensure power flows in 1 direction. We don't want an accidental spike to flow back into our laptop! This Schottky diode will also slightly resist the flow of electricity, which is good for protecting against power surges._\n\nNow let's protect from power surges that make it past the diode. We'll use a capacitor for this– it's kinda like a resevior for power. It can store up power and then release it when it's needed. If there's a power fluctuation, this capacitor will let the extra power blead out to `GND` harmlessly. We'll use a 10uF capacitor with part number [`C19702`](https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/Multilayer-Ceramic-Capacitors-MLCC-SMD-SMT_Samsung-Electro-Mechanics-CL10A106KP8NNNC_C19702.html). Let's drop it in right after the diode, and connect it to `GND`.\n\n![](https://cloud-e0ekzo8gw-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-08-08_at_17.37.55.png)\n\n_When using a capacitor to prevent overflows like this it's called a [\"decoupling capacitor\"](https://components101.com/articles/decoupling-capacitor-vs-bypass-capacitors-working-and-applications). I'll admit I don't 100% understand why, but this won't short 5V to GND._\n\nGo ahead and use the same capacitors to protect the other USB-A ports. You can copy \u0026 paste the components, and then move them into place.\n\n![](https://cloud-lr6vmvrrj-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-08-08_at_17.44.21.png)\n\n## Unused ports\n\nThe SL2.1A chip we're using supports up to 4 USB ports, but we're making a smaller board for the tutorial so we won't be using the ports for \"3\" or \"4\". Go ahead and use the \"no connection\" tool to show in the schematic that these pins aren't being used.\n\n_Making a 4-port USB hub is left as a challenge for you to do if you want to!_\n\n![](https://cloud-4sab6gwqz-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-08-08_at_17.51.45.png)\n\nAll finished should have pins connected to some label or wire, even if it's just a \"no connection\" symbol. Your PCB will error if you try to send it to the manufacturer with any pins unlabeled.\n\n![](https://cloud-me27qfpwb-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-08-08_at_17.51.54.png)\n\nNext up are pins `VDD33` and `VDD18`. Sometimes components will have these to provide lower voltages for their internal circuitry. We don't need to worry about them for this design, but the spec shows that we need to bleed off the power to `GND` using another 10uF capacitor.\n\n![](https://cloud-p9cf2w5jg-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-08-08_at_17.58.13.png)\n\nLastly, our chip provides clock circuitry through `XIN` and `XOUT` for advanced use if we wanted to overclock our USB ports. We aren't trying to do that, so we'll opt-out of it by connecting `XIN` to `GND` and marking `XOUT` as disconnected.\n\n![](https://cloud-np517gxwl-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-08-08_at_18.02.06.png)\n\nNow, let's check if all the pins are connected. Try converting the schematic to a PCB. If you see a warning pop up that means a net is missing or not connected. ![](https://cloud-dmskkj3bl-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-08-08_at_18.36.08.png)\n\n## Finished!\n\nIf all the schematic is connected you've done it!\n\n![](https://cloud-4dr6xa7qz-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0yay.gif)\n\n   \u003cAnnouncement\n            copy=\"Now make your board\"\n            caption=\"Take your board and build a working USB hub.\"\n            href=\"/batch/usb-hub/part-2\"\n            iconLeft=\"enter\"\n            color=\"primary\"\n          /\u003e\n\nNow let's move into the PCB editor to make our board.\n"

Just in case you can start with the [Schematic](https://cloud-1we5i4we0-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1schematic_schematic-usb-hub-2-port-jam_2023-08-10.pdf) and the [EasyEDA source](https://cloud-1we5i4we0-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0sch_schematic-usb-hub-2-port-jam_2023-08-10.json) we're starting with. Want to see the final result of this project? Here's a link to the final [EasyEDA Design](https://example.com)_\n\n# Building the board!\n\nNow that we have our schematic, let's turn it into a board!\n\nOur starting schematic should look like this: ![](https://cloud-dtcbpm4i4-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/2screenshot_2023-08-11_at_12.52.40.png)\n\nThis is what we're going to make: ![](https://cloud-dtcbpm4i4-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-08-11_at_13.11.34.png)\n\nOnce it's ordered, it'll look like this: ![](https://cloud-dtcbpm4i4-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1screenshot_2023-08-11_at_13.11.20.png)\n\n## Step 1: Convert the schematic to a board\n\nClick \"Design \u003e Convert to PCB\" in the top right corner of EasyEDA. This will open up the board editor.\n\n![](https://cloud-6cbfcd1xm-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-08-11_at_13.15.22.png)\n\nNext, confirm all the settings are exactly the same as– JK! these settings don't matter, just hit \"apply\" and move on:\n\n![](https://cloud-8ie7yt1k6-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-08-11_at_13.14.34.png)\n\nWe'll be confronted with our parts laying out in the editor kinda like when we started out with the schematic. We'll need to move them around to make them fit on the board.\n\n![](https://cloud-8ie7yt1k6-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1screenshot_2023-08-11_at_13.14.44.png)\n\n## Step 2: Move the parts around\n\nWe want our parts to be generally close to what they should be connected to before connecting everything all together. This will make it easier to route the traces (fancy phrase for \"wire it all up\") later.\n\nWe've got a handy little tool to help us figure out our positions though! Rat lines! These are the little blue lines that connect the pins of our parts together. We can use these to figure out where to put our parts.\n\n_This is generated from our schematic, and is why we built our schematic first! If one of the blue lines ends up looking wrong it's usually because we're missing something in our schematics._\n\nI moved the parts around a bit and ended up with this. A few things still overlap, but for the most part the lines have a clear route:\n\n![](https://cloud-5c3t0a3re-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-08-11_at_13.20.04.png)\n\n_Keep in mind you might need to rotate your parts. Go ahead and do it with the \"R\" key. You can also rotate by degrees in the \"Rotation\" field on the right toolbar._\n\n## Step 3: Route the traces (wire up the dots)\n\nNext up comes the fun part! Let's wire up our parts. This is more of an art than a science, but I recommend a couple tips:\n\n- Do `GND` last. It's very important, but the easiest to do.\n- You don't have to finish everything in one go. It usually takes a couple passes to get everything right \u0026 you'll end up with a better design if you don't force it all in one go.\n- Don't be afraid to move your parts around if you need to.\n\nFirst I'll select the \"Track\" tool on the toolbar:\n\n![](https://cloud-ikeoztttt-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1screenshot_2023-08-11_at_13.26.54.png)\n\nI'm starting with the +5V trace in this example:\n\n![](https://cloud-ikeoztttt-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-08-11_at_13.27.39.png)\n\nLastly, this wire is a little thin for us, so let's \u003cb\u003eembiggen\u003c/b\u003e it. Too small and the wire might burn out, but too big and it's hard to fit all your wires. There are a whole set of tables online that you can use to figure out the right width, but I usually just go with 0.8mm for my traces at +5V.\n\n![](https://cloud-ikeoztttt-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/2screenshot_2023-08-11_at_13.27.10.png)\n\n![](https://cloud-2dgv2s40z-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-08-11_at_13.31.56.png)\n\n_Technically, you can add an extra \"c\" to \"thicc\" for every 0.4mm of width._\n\nTake your time and route the traces you can. Here's how far I got after a couple passes:\n\n![](https://cloud-l9gg41b78-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-08-11_at_13.38.20.png)\n\nNotice that the +5V traces are still ratlined. I couldn't connect them without overlapping other traces, so I've left them unrouted for now. There's also part of the `GND` line that isn't connected yet.\n\n## Step 4: Oh, how the turn tables!\n\nNow we need more space to route our stuff! Let's break out our superpower– the other side of the board!\n\n![](https://cloud-559tio290-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0ezgif.com-video-to-gif_1_.gif)\n\nThat's right- the other side of the board can have a trace too! Some boards are pancaked together and have 4, 6, even 16 layers of traces! We're not going to be that fancy with this though– we can get away with just 2 layers for this project. Good for simplicity and keeping our costs down.\n\nLet's use this tool to route the `D-` (for some reason showing up as `U3_9` in my screenshot) pin for the USB-A male.\n\n![](https://cloud-2421gzzt3-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-08-11_at_13.48.30.png)\n\nAdd some traces to get the `U3_9` line as close as it can without overlapping anything.\n\n![](https://cloud-p4gld99aq-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-08-11_at_13.50.20.png)\n\nSwitch to the \"Via\" tool and click the tip of the traces to add them to the tips. A \"Via\" is just a fancy way to say we're poking a whole through the board to the other side that's coated in copper so the current travels through it.\n\n![](https://cloud-loxykkofo-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-08-11_at_13.50.39.png)\n\n![](https://cloud-cbdjno25j-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-08-11_at_13.51.55.png)\n\nTo switch to the other side of the board, click the \"edit\" icon next to \"BottomLayer\" on the layer toolbar. It should look like a pencil\n\n![](https://cloud-n59r7hpq4-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1screenshot_2023-08-11_at_13.46.16.png)\n\nNow we can route our traces on the bottom layer. Go ahead and connect the 2 vias we just made:\n\n![](https://cloud-8juvc3e6w-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-08-11_at_13.56.55.png)\n\nNice! Now the ratline has disappeared- that means we're all done with those pins!\n\nTry doing the rest of them on your own before continuing. Or don't... I'm just text on a website, I can't stop you from scrolling down to see the finished version.\n\n![](https://cloud-isdsylawg-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-08-11_at_14.00.12.png)\n![](https://cloud-isdsylawg-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1screenshot_2023-08-11_at_14.00.24.png)\n\n_I had to add some more traces on the \"TopLayer\" to get all my \"BackLayer\" pins to connect._\n\n## Step 5: Cut that out!\n\nNext up we'll need to cut out our board and give it a shape! We'll use the \"BoardOutline\" layer to do this. Weirdly enough, we'll still be using the route tool like before.\n\n![](https://cloud-pxqhij3q1-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-08-11_at_14.02.31.png)\n\n_You might already have a pink rectangle lying around from when you first imported your board from your schematic. Go ahead and delete that, we're making our own outline. A better outline!_\n\n![](https://cloud-dmke8w78v-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1screenshot_2023-08-11_at_14.06.12.png)\n\n\nIf your male USB port has a pink line in the footprint, make sure it's **outside** of the board outline. Some USB ports are \"sink components,\" which means that they go below the board. This makes sure to give them ample room.\n\n![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab60dfac-8d52-4314-9388-d7945c2770b0)\n![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d746092d-cd29-41b9-9dc7-de4a335959eb)\n\n\n\nI made my trace look like this, but yours can look different! Just make sure that it's a closed shape and has enough padding around the edges that we don't trim of anything important. Sometimes the cutting machine will be a little off, so it's good to have a little extra space on the sides.\n\nAlso, don't forget to even out your corners!\n\n![](https://cloud-dmke8w78v-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0ezgif.com-video-to-gif_2_.gif)\n\nNow that we have the borders cut out, let's see the results! Click \"View \u003e 3D View\" in the top toolbar.\n\n![](https://cloud-kcfrggbze-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-08-11_at_14.10.51.png)\n\n![](https://cloud-kcfrggbze-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1screenshot_2023-08-11_at_14.11.06.png)\n\nDone! That's it. You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here.\n"

Let's get you setup\n\n### Create an Account\nHead over to the [Replit Website](https://replit.com/languages/html) and create an account\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"What is Replit?\"\u003e\nReplit is a web-based independent development environment (IDE). Basically, Replit allows you to write code in your browser and instantly deploy your site to the entire world. I suppose you could say it's *magical*. \n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"If you're unable to use Replit or would rather not use Replit\"\u003e\nIf for whatever reason you have difficulty accessing Replit, visit \u003ca href=\"https://firewalledreplit.com/\"\u003eFirewalled Replit\u003c/a\u003e.\nI also recommend checking out GitHub code spaces or running a local development environment in VS Code.\nAll the code is the same regardless of the code editor you use.😉\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n\n\n### 2. Create a new Repl/Project\nWelcome to your Replit Dashboard! Once inside, tap Create a Repl and then select **HTML, CSS, and Javascript** as your template. \n\nReplit will kindly start you off with some boilerplate code (starter code). \n\n![Replit-Signup](https://cloud-c6z75ah46-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0export_jun_15_2023_0159_pm.gif)\n\n\n## Build with Elements\n\n### What are elements?\nEvery site you've ever visited has elements. Elements are the building blocks that come together to create websites. For example, this block of text is an element. The gif you'll see below is also an element. Even the container that holds the text you are reading is an element. Try right-clicking this site and tapping Inspect, you'll see a bunch of elements. HTML is the file format for these elements.\n\n![Inspect Screen](https://cloud-8ywcul7zm-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0inspect.gif)\n\n#### What makes an element?\nElements consist of three parts. \n\nElements consist of an opening tag, the content in the middle, and a closing tag. So for example `\u003cp\u003eSample Content\u003c/p\u003e` creates paragraph text because there is an opening tag (`\u003cp\u003e`), with content in the middle (`Sample Content`), and a closing tag (`\u003c/p\u003e`) indicating where the content ends \n\n![bagel](https://cloud-rd8lvcrjx-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0video.gif)\n*(bagels are a lot like tags or I suppose you could say tags are a lot like bagels... depending on your perspective)*\n\n### Where can I place them?\n\nLet's begin by deleting all the starter code that Replit gave you.\n\n![delete starter code](https://cloud-884himjr3-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0nameswitch.gif)\n\nOrpheus the Dinosaur *(don't ask who [Orpheus](https://workshops.hackclub.com/orpheus/) is)* asks that you please copy and paste the code below into your project\n\n```\n\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e\n\u003chtml\u003e\n\n  \u003cbody\u003e\n  \n  \u003c/body\u003e\n\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\nThe body of your site is contained inside of an opening tag (`\u003cbody\u003e`) and a closing tag (`\u003c/body\u003e`). The content of your site goes inside the body.  **Inside your body is where you'll place your elements.**\n\nIt's sort of like how cream cheese goes inside a bagel. A bagel has a top and bottom and all of the tasty cream cheese in the middle.\n\nLet's fill your body tag sandwich with some tasty content! 🥯\n\n### How can I make elements for my welcome screen?\nInside of your body tags, let's write some code\n\n```\n\u003cbody\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eHello world!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/body\u003e\n```\n\nYou've created your first element \u0026 it's a `\u003cp\u003e` element (p stands for paragraph)! Congratulations!\n\nLet's try making a heading! Simply create a new element with h1 tags.\n```\n\u003cbody\u003e\n  \u003ch1\u003eWelcome to my OS\u003c/h1\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eHello world!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/body\u003e\n```\n\nAwesome. We can also make smaller headings. `h1` is the largest heading, but you can also create an `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, \u0026 so on. \n\n```\n\u003cbody\u003e\n  \u003ch1\u003eWelcome to my OS\u003c/h1\u003e\n  \u003ch2\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eHello world!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/body\u003e\n```\n\nThe text is neat, but let's add an image:\nFirst, we need to drag an image into the Replit file manager.\n\n![Drag \u0026 Drop](https://cloud-id4r1tr7g-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0drag_drop.gif)\n\n```\n\u003cbody\u003e\n  \u003ch1\u003eWelcome to my OS\u003c/h1\u003e\n  \u003ch2\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eHello world!\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"./nameOfImage.jpeg\" /\u003e\n\u003c/body\u003e\n```\n\nYou can also do a direct link to the image (as .png, .jpeg, etc at the end of the URL), so for example here's code for placing an image of a Capybara \n\n`\u003cimg src=\"./imageOfMe.png\" /\u003e`\n\nThe image tag has a property of `src` which stands for source. You can pass in the direct link to the image or import an image and set the src as `\"./imageName.png\"`.\n\n![Website with text on top and a Capybara image](https://cloud-33eico6lp-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-06-16_at_11.54.32_am.png)\n\n### Let's link to another page\nHTML (HyperText Markup Language) was built for scientists to be able to share research documents (\u0026 is now used on every website on the internet). If you know anything about scientists, then you know they LOVE to reference other pages. \n\nFor this reason, HTML makes it easy for you to hyperlink to other pages.\n\n```\n\u003cbody\u003e\n  (rest of your content)\n  \u003ca href=\"https://example.com/\"\u003elabel\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/body\u003e\n```\n\nReplace the label with the label of the button (so for example [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/starthackclub/)) and link with the URL (like https://www.instagram.com/starthackclub/).\n\nYou can use this to link to a personal social media, a GitHub, a random website about your favorite creature, or just not make a tag at the moment. It's totally up to you. \n\n## Personalize Your Content\nSoo... surprise, you didn't realize but you just started your onboarding screen for your operating system.\n\n**Go ahead and fill it up with your content.** \n\nDon't know what to add? Perhaps try:\n* Linking to your favorite playlist\n* Adding a picture of a pet\n* Writing a bit about your favorite hobbies\n* etc\n\n### Customize the text content and image\nMake the text content whatever you would like users to see when they first land on your site. Be creative and have fun with it! \n\nSelect an image for your site that represents you (either literally like a selfie or metaphorically like your favorite creature) by changing the src of the image to a URL or path to your image. \n\n### Additional Challenge \nDiscover some unique tags on the [W3 Tags Site](https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/default.asp). There are 100+  tags for you to experiment with. Go dive into the W3 Tags Directory and find some random tags and experiment with them on your site. Have fun :) \n\nhere are some tags we really like:\n* `\u003cs\u003eStrike Through\u003c/s\u003e`\n* `\u003cp\u003ebreak the \u003c/br\u003e line like this\u003c/p\u003e`\n* `\u003cp\u003euse strong to \u003cstrong\u003ebold text\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e`\n* `\u003cp\u003e \u003cdfn\u003eDFN Tag\u003c/dfn\u003e is a tag that marks something being defined\u003c/p\u003e`\n* `\u003cp\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"abbreviation\"\u003eabbr\u003c/abbr\u003e is a tag that marks an abbreviated term\u003c/p\u003e`\n\n\n### Content Complete\nOkay, so you should now have the content for your \"Welcome to My OS\" screen and it should feel totally unique to you (i.e. if a friend saw your welcome screen, they would immediately know it was your OS).\n\nYour content most likely looks rather bland and uninteresting which leads us into our next topic... styling our content!\n\n![content styling in progress](https://cloud-9jc9u3xyy-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-06-16_at_3.51.07_pm.png)\n\n## Style Your Elements\n### What's a style?\nA style is a property-value pair that changes the way an element looks.\n\nStyles can exist within an HTML file when written in-line, but can also be in a separate file (styles.css). For now, we're going to write the styles inside of our HTML file (inside of opening tags)\n\nTo apply a style, it's as simple as:\n`\u003ctag style=\"property: value\"\u003e content \u003c/tag\u003e`\n\n**Every style has a property and a value.** \nFor example, a style may be color with the value of red (to turn the text red)\n\n### Styling Color 🎨\nTo change the color text you would simply write\n`\u003cp style=\"color: red\"\u003eThis text is red\u003c/p\u003e`\n\nYou can also add a background color: \n```\n\u003cbody style=\"background-color: #c9ffcf\"\u003e\n  // your content//\n\u003c/body\u003e\n```\n\nEasy, right? \n\n*p.s. you'll notice I used hex (#c9ffcf) instead of the name of a color (red) for the second example. Hex is a format for representing color. You can use either the name of a color or the hex value. To find hex values, try googling \"hex color picker\"\n\n### Styling Shape \u0026 Size\nImages can have styles too!\n\nYour image is probably very large. Let's change the size \u0026 shape.\n\n\n**IF YOUR IMAGE IS TOO LARGE OR TOO SMALL, BE SURE TO ADJUST THE HEIGHT AND WIDTH AS IS DONE BELOW** \n\nSimply go to the image and apply a style property that sets the width and height: \n\n`\u003cimg style=\"width: 64px; height: 64px\" src=\"https://cloud-pc8imajxj-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1img_1181.jpg\" /\u003e`\n\nI chose to make the width and height 64px, but you don't have to! Pick your own size, play with it, and have fun!\n\n*Note: Semicolons are used to separate CSS properties*\n\n##### *\\*Crunch*\\*\nYour image might be a bit crunched up. Try to Google how to fix this (maybe even ask GPT). Even a very basic search term such as What is the CSS Property for making an image not crunch, would probably work.\n\n![crunched image](https://cloud-4cdvjzqmo-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-06-16_at_12.43.50_pm.png)\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"Solution\"\u003e\n  Upon scrubbing through the results, I found the `object-fit: cover` property. Let's try applying that to our image. Ah lovely, and just like that our image is uncrunched. Whenever you run into something that looks ugly and you want to make it look beautiful, just google it and Google will help you out.\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n\n##### *\\*Rounddddd*\\*\nOptionally, you can round your corners. Try googling this! (maybe you can even turn your image into a circle shape if you'd like)\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"Solution\"\u003e\nYou probably found a nifty little CSS property called border-radius. \nsimply write style=\"border-radius: 16px; object-fit: cover\" on your image tag.\nNote: Semicolons are used to separate CSS properties\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n\n![rounded image](https://cloud-b43epg4q2-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-06-16_at_3.59.41_pm.png)\n\n### Styling Font\nAdding a font in CSS is easy!\n\nThe easiest way to add a font is to visit the [W3 Library of browser-built-in fonts](https://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/fonts.en.html) and select one that fits the vibe of your site! \n\nOnce you pick out your favorite font(s), go to the body and put a style property of font-family on the opening tag.\n\n`\u003cbody style=\"font-family: Helvetica, Noto Sans, sans-serif\"\u003e`\n\n*Note: If you want cooler fonts, checkout [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and [this document for learning how to integrate a Google font into your project](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started).*  *You'll need to put a link inside `head` tags (which includes content that is not visible on the site, but that the browser uses to configure the site)*\n\n*Additional Note: not all computers have access to the same fonts, so if a computer does not have access to a font, it will go to the next one in the list. For this reason, I suggest putting selecting your favorite three fonts and putting them in order from most-liked to least-liked.*\n\n*Final Note: you can use the font-size property and font-weight property to further change the visual appearance of a text element*  \n\n### Styling Space ✨\nSpace is created by a combination of Margin (not margarine, MARGIN) and padding (fluff).\n\nMargin is the space between your picture frames on your wall. \n\nPadding is the gap between the photo and the frame. If you had a box with an item in the middle, the space between the object in the center and the walls of the box is padding. \n\nAlso... here's a comedy skit by Shubham at Epoch Bay Area to learn about Margin and Padding\n\n\u003cvideo src=\"https://cloud-2jto14u7d-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0vid_20221230_184903086.mp4\" controls=\"controls\" style={{maxWidth: \"480px\"}}\u003e\n\u003c/video\u003e\n\nWe'll get more into this later, but right now I would just like to bring our items closer together. \n\n![spaced out](https://cloud-5txt6wpqn-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-06-16_at_4.12.11_pm.png)\n\nSo if we open the inspect window...\n\n![Margin is the problem](https://cloud-p8iio5lh4-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-06-16_at_4.19.38_pm.png)\n\nWe can see that the default margin on the h1 is quite large and it's making the site look a bit awkward. Let's correct that. \n\nLet's reduce the margin on the h1 tag\n\n` \u003ch1 style=\"margin: 4px;\"\u003ethomasOS\u003c/h1\u003e`\n\n*Note: px stands for pixels, so we now have a 4px space on all sides for the header text element*\n\nIf you wanted to add some space within your heading, you could add padding, so perhaps make it\n` \u003ch1 style=\"padding: 4px; margin: 4px; background-color: #000; color: #fff\"\u003ethomasOS\u003c/h1\u003e`\n(you can see the padding added a gap between the walls of the element and the content itself)\n\n### Keep Hacking! \n\nTry adding the `background-color`, `color`, and `font-family` properties on your `body` tag to make your site look funky (or whatever style you're going for). Not sure how to use those styles? Google it!\n\nThis is what mine looked like after some tinkering. Go for whatever makes you smile! This was just my style at the moment of writing the Jam.\n![what mine looked like](https://cloud-nzaoewszc-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-07-23_at_2.31.58_pm.png)\n\n\n\n*Note: with both padding and margin, you can change the spacing in a specific direction by appending -top, -bottom, -right, or -left. For example you could add margin-top: 4px; or padding-left: 16px;*\n\nAlright, lovely! Here's my finished site for this episode of the batch. I hope your site looks nothing like this! Please take the opportunity to have fun with this site and do something wild!\n\n![Finished Site](https://cloud-423oznftn-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-06-16_at_4.27.35_pm.png)\n\n*Note: You'll notice I added some unique-looking tags inside the paragraph text, YOU CAN DO THAT TOO BY CHECKING OUT THE SOMEWHAT OPTIONAL ADDITIONAL CHALLENGE BELOW.*\n\n\n## Next time on building your own PersonalOS...\nIn the next episode, we will build the foundation of our OS by:\n* Adding a wallpaper\n* Creating Your Window\n* Creating the top bar\n* Tracking time with JS\n"

I commend your efforts.\n\nToday we're going to be diving into JavaScript and combining it with the HTML \u0026 CSS we learned about last time. Don't worry, you'll probably survive. We'll dive into JavaScript at the end of this Jam. \n\nYou'll be adding your outlining your window, creating your desktop, and adding a top bar.\n\n![ending with](https://cloud-d6rlms9ox-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\n\nWhile we will be writing JavaScript, all code will still remain in the HTML file *(until next time on WebOS Jams)*\n\n**Outline:**\n1. **Defining Our “Window”**\n2. **Making Our Desktop** *(+ finding the coolest desktop images)*\n3. **Topping off with a Top Bar** *(+ letting time tell)*\n\n## Defining the \"Window\"\nAlrighty, so you ended off last time with the start of your welcome screen. Hopefully, it looks nothing like mine. As a reminder, here's what mine looked like:\n\n![Window where we left off](https://cloud-p1jqe7wd2-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-06-21_at_1.24.32_pm.png)\n\n### What is a window?\nA window is a box that defines where an application on your user interface (UI) starts and ends. I suppose a div could be any shape (if you want your windows to be circles, go for it!). \n\nAs web developers, we refer to groupings/boxes as divs. You can create divs inside of divs if, for example, you had a bento box, that box itself is a group and then each little section within that group is a group. \n\nThe walls inside the box define where the content (tasty food) starts \u0026 ends \u0026 the walls along the edge of the box define where the box begins \u0026 ends. \n\n![Bento Box of Divs](https://cloud-e63a9spt4-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0divbento.png)\n\n### Why do we need a window?\nHaving multiple windows will allow you to make users feel in control of their experience (by choosing which windows to open and focus on and which to ignore) and provide a novel/fun experience.\n\nWe need to create a div to group together the content of your window to define where your window begins and where it ends. \n\n### Creating our Window\nLet's group all of our content within a div tag. \n\nThat should look something like...\n\n```html\n    \u003cbody\u003e\n        \u003cdiv\u003e\n            (the content of your site)\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/body\u003e\n```\n\nCool... well you're site hopefully looks the same \u0026 you may be thinking you did something wrong. \n\n![grouped in a div](https://cloud-czlk8j3wo-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-06-21_at_1.57.38_pm.png)\n\nFear not, you're on the right path. The group has no style attributes that would make it visually distinct from the rest of the page **yet**.\n\n### Outlining our Window\nAlrighty, let's apply a style on our div (yeah... you can apply styles to divs)\n\n```html\n    \u003cdiv style=\"border: solid;\"\u003e\n        (content)\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\nSimple! Now we can see that we outlined our content. \n\n![stroke added](https://cloud-cn54hr3si-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-06-21_at_2.04.50_pm.png)\n\n*Hey... wanna have some fun? Visit [this site of border styles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border) and try adding some cool border effects (+ also your own width and color)*\n\n### Finding our Boundary\nWe can set the width and height of our box (div) using the style property. \n\nAt the moment our box is taking up the width of the entire site!\n\nLet's change it to a fixed width.\n\n```html\n    \u003cdiv style=\"border: solid; width: 128px;\"\u003e\n        (content)\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\nI chose 128 pixels, but you choose whatever size you'd like. If you'd like to be REALLY NIFTY you can also do `\u003cdiv style=\"width: fit-content\"\u003e`\nwhich will make the div fit the width of your content.\n\nAlso, remember how last time how we rounded the corners of our image using border-radius? Try rounding the corners of your div:\n\n`\u003cdiv style=\"border: solid; width: 128px; border-radius: 16px\"\u003e`\n\nI chose 16px, but you can also make it much rounder by increasing that number! Experiment with it!\n\n![image of it without space](https://cloud-25a3olvni-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-06-21_at_2.21.27_pm.png)\n\nAHH THE TEXT IS VERY *CLAUSTROPHOBIC*. YOU PUT IT IN A BOX AND IT HAS NOOOO BREATHING ROOM!\n\nADD PADDING FASTTTT\n\n```html\n    \u003cdiv style=\"padding: 16px; (additional styles)\"\u003e\n        (content)\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\nah... that feels *much* better...\n\n(p.s. don't do 16px padding, do what feels right to you)\n\n### Placing our Window\nWe have a screen and we have an element (our window). We want to place our element on top of our window and specify where we want it to be on the screen.\n\nBecause our window is going to exist on top of our desktop we need to use position absolute (which means that the position will not be relative to other items, but rather relative to the screen).\n\n\nYou don't totally need to understand position absolute right now. As we go deeper into the batch, it will start to make more sense. \n\n```html\n    \u003cdiv style=\"position: absolute; (additional styles)\"\u003e\n        (content)\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\nAwesome and with the `position: absolute` property, we unlock four more properties (top, bottom, left, right). Each one defines the distance that our window will be from the edges of the screen.\n\n![This is the screen](https://cloud-rn4u95i7l-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0thisisthescreen.gif)\n\nTo place it in the center, we can simply write\n\n```html\n    \u003cdiv style=\"position: absolute; top: 50%; left: 50%; (additional styles)\"\u003e\n        (content)\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\nHmm.. well that doesn't look quite right. The reason why is that the top, left, bottom, and right properties define how far the top left corner of our window is from the walls of our browser. To fix this, let's adjust the window so that the center of the window is the point that we're positioning around by using the `transform: translate(-50%, -50%)` property. \n\n```html\n    \u003cdiv style=\"position: absolute; top: 50%; left: 50%; \ntransform: translate(-50%, -50%); (additional styles)\"\u003e\n        (content)\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\n![Image centered correctly](https://cloud-d0am8h8gg-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-06-21_at_2.42.10_pm.png)\n\nAlrighty great this is looking lovely.\n\nThis may be a good time to take a stretch break. You've been doing a lot of coding \u0026 your site is looking beautiful!\n\n![Break](https://cloud-5gpc0802p-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0ezgif-2-da8e476e69.gif)\n\n## Designing Our Desktop\nYou're back. You're refreshed. Maybe you even ate a strawberry or two \n~~(or maybe a whole package of strawberries)~~. \n\n### Adding The Desktop Background \nAdding the background is surprisingly easy! \n\n1. Find your image (I'll be using a photo I took in Michigan)\n2. Drag it into Replit (the file manager)\n3. On your body tag as the style property of `background-image: url(./NAME_OF_YOUR_IMAGE.png)`\n4. Adding `background-size: cover;` to the body to make the size of the image fit the screen.\n5. If your image still isn't quite fitting, add height: 100vh as a property to your body. This will make the height of the background 100% of the vertical height of your browser.\n\n*(optional bonus challenge, try using a gif instead of a png)*\n\n### Separating the Window from the Desktop\nAlright well, this is looking beautiful!\n\nLet's add a background color to our window so it looks visually distinct from the desktop. \n\n![background color added](https://cloud-4xp54hvar-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-06-21_at_3.31.34_pm.png)\n\n## Creating Our Top Bar\nA top bar is generally used to display the name of the OS, key functions of a selected application, and the time. You can choose to display all or none of these pieces of information. You may also decide to give it different functions! \n\nI'll show you how you can add the name of the OS and the time. You can do whatever you want with it though!\n\n### Creating the Foundation\n\nAlright, let's start by just making a div (a group) to contain our top bar.\n\n```html\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\n### Horizontally Aligning The Elements\n\nNow... let's add some text and make the text horizontally aligned (by using `display: flex` which by default places text into columns)\n\n```html\n    \u003cdiv style=\"display: flex;\"\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003e\n            ThomasOS\n        \u003c/p\u003e \n        \u003cp\u003e\n            6/21/2023 3:41 PM\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\nNote: Aye... I heard you want to master Flex. Is that right? If so, I CHALLENGE YOU (yes you) TO TAKE ON THE ULTIMATE FLEXBOX FROGGY CHALLENGE (basically tap [this link and play a super fun game to learn about flex](https://flexboxfroggy.com/))\n\n### Customizing the Spacing\n\nWe can optionally space out the content by applying justify-content (check out [this justify-content testing site](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/playdemo.php?filename=playcss_justify-content) to see how you can use justify-content to space out content)\n\n![justify-content](https://cloud-e3m7dz3v0-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-06-21_at_3.52.01_pm.png)\nbased on this demo, I decided I want to use space-between in the example below, but I encourage you to check out the testing site and pick what justify-content style works best for your design! \n\n```html\n    \u003cdiv style=\"display: flex; justify-content: space-between\"\u003e\n        (content)\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\n### Translucent Background\nNow you can also add a semi-transparent background to your top bar by using RGBA. Try adding \n\nRGBA stands for Red, Green, Blue, Alpha where Alpha is the level of transparency (0 being fully transparent and 1 being no-transparency or opaque). You can also google RGB color picker and then manually write the transparency from 0 to 1. \n\nHere's an example.\n\n```html\n  \u003cdiv\n    style=\"position: absolute; width: 100%; display: flex; backdrop-filter: blur(10px); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25); color: #fff; justify-content: space-between;\"\u003e\n    \u003cp style=\"margin-left: 16px;\"\u003e\n      ThomasOS\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003cp style=\"margin-right: 16px;\"\u003e\n      6/21/2023 3:41 PM\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\n*Note: You'll also notice I threw in a backdrop-filter to blur the background. You can do that too!*\n\n*Note: Please don't just copy this. Make it your own and make it look interesting in your visual aesthetic. This Jam is an absolute waste of your time if you're not experimenting and having fun while doing it. This isn't homework, this is your freedom, this is your art, this is your life! Enjoy it!*\n\n### Personalize It\n\nAt this point, you don't need your hand held. Let's take off the training wheels and try making it look cool in your own way.\n\nHere's how I decided to make mine look\n\n![my top bar](https://cloud-5ozikpqtx-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-06-21_at_4.19.33_pm.png)\n\nI hope yours looks totally different!\nHere's my code in case you want to take some inspiration from it. (but again, DON'T MAKE AN EXACT STYLE COPY) \n```html\n\n  \u003cdiv\n    style=\"position: absolute; width: 100%; display: flex; backdrop-filter: blur(10px); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.125); color: #fff; justify-content: space-between; gap: 32px;\"\u003e\n        \u003cp\n          style=\"margin-left: 16px; font-weight: 700; background-color: rgba(256, 256, 256, 0.125); padding: 4px 12px; border-radius: 16px;\"\u003e\n            ThomasOS\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp style=\"margin-left: 16px; background-color: rgba(256, 256, 256, 0.25); padding: 4px 12px; border-radius: 16px;\"\u003e\n            ☀️ Always Learning ☁️\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp\n          style=\"margin-right: 16px; background-color: rgba(256, 256, 256, 0.125); padding: 4px 12px; border-radius: 16px;\"\u003e\n            6/21/2023 3:41 PM\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\nIdeas to spice it up:\n* Try different putting different content in the top bar\n* Try a different color\n* Try including more or fewer elements\n* Include an image in your nav \n* Make it a bottom bar! (using the absolute positioning and the bottom property instead of the top property)\n\n### Tracking The Time\nI promised you JavaScript, so of course I am going to give you JavaScript.\n\nJavaScript brings logic to your website. It's how your OS will respond to events (whether those be user events or events like the changing of time).\n\nWe can write JavaScript in its own file, or we can just write in the HTML file inside of a `\u003cscript\u003e` tag. We're going to start inside the HTML file. \n\n#### Where Do I Write JavaScript? \n\nYou can include your script tag in the HTML file. \n\n```html\n\u003chtml\u003e\n    \u003cbody\u003e\n        (site content)\n        \u003cscript\u003e\n            (JavaScript Code)\n        \u003c/script\u003e\n    \u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\n**At the moment we're going to be writing our code inside of our HTML file. We're not touching the script.js file yet *(until next Jam)***\n\n![Write it in index.html](https://cloud-jajja5k48-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0cat.png)\n\n#### How Do I Get the Time? \n\nLet's begin by getting the time and storing it in a variable.\n\n```html\n\u003cscript\u003e\n    var currentTime = new Date().toLocaleString();\n\u003c/script\u003e\n```\n\nAlright, let's break this down. \n\nThe var keyword indicates that we're creating a variable. \n\ncurrentTime is the name of the variable that we're creating. We could've given this variable any name (I encourage you to try naming it something else, just for fun).\n\nnew Date().toLocaleString(); is a browser function that gets the current date and formats it into plain text (what we hackers call a String). \n\n*Note: You don't need to know `new Date().toLocaleString`, you only need to know how to google \"How do I get the current date as a String in JavaScript\"*\n\n#### How Do I Display the Time?\nWe have a value in JavaScript and we want to put it inside of our HTML text.\n\nHere's how we go about doing that.\n\n##### Mark the text we'd like to alter\nLet's add an \"id\" to the time text so we can select it. Here's how that might look:\n```html\n    \u003cp id=\"timeElement\"\n      style=\"(YOUR STYLES)\"\u003e\n      Time\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n```\n\n##### Select it in JavaScript\nWe can use a querySelector to select the element and store it in a variable. We pass into the querySelector the id of the element we're working with:\n\n```html\n\u003cscript\u003e\n    var currentTime = new Date().toLocaleString();\n    var timeText = document.querySelector(\"#timeElement\");\n\u003c/script\u003e\n```\n*Note: We placed a # in front of the id name to indicate it is an id*\n\n##### Alter The Selected Element In JavaScript\n\nFinally, we can set the innerHTML (the peanut butter in the bagel sandwich) and change the value (perhaps to cream cheese).\n\n```html\n\u003cscript\u003e\n    var currentTime = new Date().toLocaleString();\n    var timeText = document.querySelector(\"#timeElement\");\n    timeText.innerHTML = currentTime\n\u003c/script\u003e   \n```\n\n![time being displayed](https://cloud-rl0do8tyh-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-06-21_at_4.44.46_pm.png)\n\nBoom, now we get the current time, but don't be too quick to celebrate. You'll notice the time doesn't update. This is because the code inside the script tag only runs a single time (when the page is first opened).\n\nWe need it to run every second. \n\n##### Make it run every second \nWe can use the setInterval function to make the code repeat every 1000 milliseconds (every second).\n\nHere's how we can go about doing that \n```html\n  \u003cscript\u003e\n\n    function updateTime() {\n        var currentTime = new Date().toLocaleString();\n        var timeText = document.querySelector(\"#timeElement\");\n        timeText.innerHTML = currentTime;\n    }\n    setInterval(updateTime, 1000);\n\n  \u003c/script\u003e\n```\n\nI placed our previous code into a function (think of a function as an operation that we're telling the machine to run) and put that function inside of a setInterval (think of this as a robot that does the function every set amount of time). \n\nThese five lines of code are very readable, but what if I told you there was a way to do it in just 3 lines line. \n\nTry updating the time every second in just three lines and then check the solution below\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"Solution\"\u003e\n\n```javascript\nsetInterval(function () {\n  document.querySelector(\"#timeElement\").innerHTML = new Date().toLocaleString();\n}, 1000);\n```\n\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\nLovely, here's what we've ended up with:\n\n![PersonalOS](https://cloud-r3drmd84c-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-06-21_at_4.59.32_pm.png)\n\nFor your final bonus challenge, try adding something interesting to your background. Maybe make it a gif?\n\nRemember, this is your site.\n\nFarewell, my dearest Hacker. \nI suspect we shall meet again... in the next Jam. \n\nWhat will be there?\nThat's for me to know and for you to find out 👀"

Confront your fears, you must, for a Jedi JavaScript master you have the potential to become.\n \nToday we're going to be making our windows movable and throwing in some JavaScript magic (you'll see later what I mean by this).  Here's what that looks like:\n\n![Sample Outcome Gif](https://cloud-1v30rbp0i-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/00gif.gif)\n\n**Outline:**\n1. **Organizing Our Logic**\n2. **Making Our Window Movable**\n3. **Adding a Handle**\n4. **Opening \u0026 Closing the Window** \n5. **Organizing Our Styles**\n\n## Organizing Our Logic\nOur index.html file is getting a bit messy. Let's try splitting our Logic (JavaScript) from our Content (HTML) by moving the JavaScript code to it's own `script.js` file.\n\n![splitting files](https://cloud-pfegd9qpz-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0twofiles.gif)\n\nAs a reminder, this is what my code looked like at the end of the last Jam:\n\u003cDropdown title=\"My Code (pls don't copy paste)\"\u003e\n```html\n\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e\n\u003chtml\u003e\n\u003cbody\n  style=\"font-family: Noto Sans, system-ui, sans-serif; height: 100vh; background-image: url(./beautifulImage.png); background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat; margin: 0px;\"\u003e\n\n  \u003cdiv style=\" border: solid; padding: 16px; border-radius: 16px; width: fit-content; position: absolute; top: 50%; left:\n  50%; transform: translate(-50%, -50%); background: #fff; justify-content: center;\"\u003e\n\n    \u003cimg src=\"https://cloud-pc8imajxj-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1img_1181.jpg\"\n      style=\"width: 64px; height: 64px; border-radius: 32px; object-fit: cover;\" /\u003e\n    \u003ch1 style=\"margin: 4px;\"\u003ethomasOS\u003c/h1\u003e\n    \u003cp style=\"margin: 0px;\"\u003e\n      \u003cdfn\u003eThomasOS\u003c/dfn\u003e is a feature-limited \u003cabbr title=\"Operating System\"\u003eOS\u003c/abbr\u003e to answer the \u003cbr /\u003e\n      unanswerable\n      question of \u003ccode\u003e\"who is Thomas?\"\u003c/code\u003e\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\n  \u003cdiv\n    style=\"position: absolute; width: 100%; display: flex; backdrop-filter: blur(10px); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.125); color: #fff; justify-content: space-between; gap: 32px;\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\n      style=\"margin-left: 16px; font-weight: 700; background-color: rgba(256, 256, 256, 0.125); padding: 4px 12px; border-radius: 16px;\"\u003e\n      ThomasOS\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003cp style=\"margin-left: 16px; background-color: rgba(256, 256, 256, 0.25); padding: 4px 12px; border-radius: 16px;\"\u003e\n      ☀️ Always Learning ☁️\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003cp id=\"timeElement\"\n      style=\"margin-right: 16px; background-color: rgba(256, 256, 256, 0.125); padding: 4px 12px; border-radius: 16px;\"\u003e\n\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\n  \u003cscript\u003e\n    function updateTime() {\n      var currentTime = new Date().toLocaleString();\n      var timeText = document.querySelector(\"#timeElement\");\n      timeText.innerHTML = currentTime;\n    }\n\n    setInterval(updateTime, 1000);\n\n  \u003c/script\u003e\n\n\u003c/body\u003e\n\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n\nLet's take that JavaScript logic and paste it into the script.js file (which you'll see on your file manager).\n\n### Connecting Script File to HTML File\nInside of our HTML file we display what the user sees in the body tags. To make a reference to our script file, we need to make a script tag in at the bottom of our body element and set the source to our script file. \n\n```html\n\u003cbody\u003e\n\t(content)\n  \u003cscript src=\"script.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n\u003c/body\u003e\n```\n\n\n### Celebration\n![time works](https://cloud-9pbmhw7on-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-06-22_at_3.21.44_pm.png)\nGreat, it worked! Now going forward we'll write our JavaScript code in script.js and our HTML in index.html.\n\n## Making The Window Movable\n\n![Draggable](https://cloud-1didasla4-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0draggable.gif)\nMaking the window move is honestly one of the more difficult parts of this Batch. Let's see if we can find an online resource that can help us out...\n\n*one google search later*\n\nAh yes here we go:  [How To Create a Draggable HTML Element W3 School](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_draggable.asp)\n\nAccording to this site, we need to \n1) apply an id to our welcome window div\n1) make it display absolute (already done ✅)\n2) create a function for dragging the element (that gets the position of the cursor and sets the position of the element to the position of the mouse)\n3) run said function on the welcome window div. \n\n### Identifying the Welcome Screen\nLet's slap an id on the welcome screen\n```html\n\u003cdiv id=\"welcome\" styles=\"(styles)\"\u003e\n\t(welcome screen content)\n\u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\n### Grabbing the Dragging Logic\nLet's take the code provided by W3 School and drop it into our script.js file. Here's the the code provided on the W3 School site (we adjusted some of the variable names to make it more readable):\n\n```javascript\n// Make the DIV element draggable:\ndragElement(document.getElementById(\"mydiv\"));\n\n// Step 1: Define a function called `dragElement` that makes an HTML element draggable.\nfunction dragElement(element) {\n  // Step 2: Set up variables to keep track of the element's position.\n  var initialX = 0;\n  var initialY = 0;\n  var currentX = 0;\n  var currentY = 0;\n\n  // Step 3: Check if there is a special header element associated with the draggable element.\n  if (document.getElementById(element.id + \"header\")) {\n    // Step 4: If present, assign the `dragMouseDown` function to the header's `onmousedown` event.\n    // This allows you to drag the window around by its header.\n    document.getElementById(element.id + \"header\").onmousedown = startDragging;\n  } else {\n    // Step 5: If not present, assign the function directly to the draggable element's `onmousedown` event.\n    // This allows you to drag the window by holding down anywhere on the window.\n    element.onmousedown = startDragging;\n  }\n\n  // Step 6: Define the `startDragging` function to capture the initial mouse position and set up event listeners.\n  function startDragging(e) {\n    e = e || window.event;\n    e.preventDefault();\n    // Step 7: Get the mouse cursor position at startup.\n    initialX = e.clientX;\n    initialY = e.clientY;\n    // Step 8: Set up event listeners for mouse movement (`elementDrag`) and mouse button release (`closeDragElement`).\n    document.onmouseup = stopDragging;\n    document.onmousemove = dragElement;\n  }\n\n  // Step 9: Define the `elementDrag` function to calculate the new position of the element based on mouse movement.\n  function dragElement(e) {\n    e = e || window.event;\n    e.preventDefault();\n    // Step 10: Calculate the new cursor position.\n    currentX = initialX - e.clientX;\n    currentY = initialY - e.clientY;\n    initialX = e.clientX;\n    initialY = e.clientY;\n    // Step 11: Update the element's new position by modifying its `top` and `left` CSS properties.\n    element.style.top = (element.offsetTop - currentY) + \"px\";\n    element.style.left = (element.offsetLeft - currentX) + \"px\";\n  }\n\n  // Step 12: Define the `stopDragging` function to stop tracking mouse movement by removing the event listeners.\n  function stopDragging() {\n    document.onmouseup = null;\n    document.onmousemove = null;\n  }\n}\n```\n*(btw you'll notice comments inside of the javascript marked by `//` which are segments of code that do not perform any function but rather make the code significantly more readable)*\n\nSuper confused? Here's what is happening:\nThe awesome `dragElement` function lets you drag and move the window around. It takes in an element and then adds this ability to it. The function captures the window's starting position and keeps track of its current position. \n\nIf there's a header element (like a handle), it hooks up the magic of dragging to it (but not the rest of your window). But even without a header, you can still grab and move that window from anywhere inside it. \n\n![Handle Draggable](https://cloud-ojqjpbzs3-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0handledraggable.gif)\n*(in the example above, the pencil if your window's handle)*\n\nThe `startDragging` function is in charge of getting things rolling, capturing the initial mouse position and setting up the moves and release. \n\nAs you move your mouse, the `dragElement` function works its magic, calculating the new position of the window and smoothly updating it on the screen. \n\nWhen you're done with the dragging extravaganza, the `stopDragging` function steps in and says, \"No more mouse tracking!\" by removing the event listeners. Now, go forth and drag those windows!!! (btw if this doesn't totally make sense, don't stress! You'll get it with time.)\n\n### Applying The Dragging Logic\nLet's change the first line of code to select window instead of \"mydiv\"\n\n```javascript\ndragElement(document.getElementById(\"window\"));  \n```\n\n\nWaaahooooooo \nOur div is moving!\n\n## Adding A Handle\nIf we look at the code provided by W3 School:\n```javascript\nif (document.getElementById(elmnt.id + \"header\")) {\n\t// if present, the header is where you move the DIV from:\n\tdocument.getElementById(elmnt.id + \"header\").onmousedown = dragMouseDown;\n} else {\n\t// otherwise, move the DIV from anywhere inside the DIV:\n\telmnt.onmousedown = dragMouseDown;\n}\n```\n\nthe provided code segment above indicates that if we create an element with the name of our element and \"header\", then we'll be able to make it only draggable from that element. \n\nLet's see if it actually works\n\n(back to our HTML File inside of our page body)\n```html\n\u003cdiv id=\"welcome\"\u003e\n\t\u003cp id=\"welcomeheader\"\u003e \n\t\tHandle\n\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\nAwesome\n\n![Handle Added](https://cloud-l4ck638kz-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0osmove.gif)\n\n\u003cComment githubUser=\"jianmin-chen\"\u003e\nHey... the creator of this Jam missed out on a huge upgrade to the site, but dw, I'll let you in on the inside scoop. You can avoid annoying underlining of the handle text on drag by adding `user-select: none;` \u0026 `cursor: grab;`\n\u003c/Comment\u003e\n\nNow it's time for you to customize your handle and make it look hover you'd like. Perhaps:\n\n1) Add an icon as an image that conveys that the window can be dragged from that point\n2) Place the handle in the div at the top and style similar to a traditional window\n3) Make the \"Handle\" text look quite cool and leave it as text\n4) Make it look like a door handle\n\n\n\nHere's what I decided to do (I hope yours looks nothing like this)\n![Window Screen Effect](https://cloud-n6ytrol13-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0gif.gif)\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"My Code (please don't copy!)\"\u003e\n```html\n  \u003cdiv id=\"welcome\"\n    style=\"border: solid; display: flex; flex-direction: column; border-radius: 16px; position: absolute; top: calc(50% - 90px); left: calc(50% - 180px); backdrop-filter: blur(4px); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.125); \"\u003e\n    \u003cdiv id=\"welcomeheader\"\n      style=\"width: 100%; display: flex; align-items: center; cursor: move; justify-content: center; margin-top: 8px;\"\u003e\n      \u003cp style=\"margin: 0px; color: #fff; font-weight: 500\"\u003eWelcome\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003cdiv style=\"background-color: #fff; margin: 6px; border-radius: 12px; width: 360px; padding: 16px;\"\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"https://cloud-pc8imajxj-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1img_1181.jpg\"\n        style=\"width: 64px; height: 64px; border-radius: 32px; object-fit: cover;\" /\u003e\n      \u003ch1 style=\"margin: 4px;\"\u003ethomasOS\u003c/h1\u003e\n      \u003cp style=\"margin: 0px;\"\u003e\n        \u003cdfn\u003eThomasOS\u003c/dfn\u003e is a feature-limited \u003cabbr title=\"Operating System\"\u003eOS\u003c/abbr\u003e to answer the \u003cbr /\u003e\n        unanswerable\n        question of \u003ccode\u003e\"who is Thomas?\"\u003c/code\u003e\n      \u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n\n\n## Opening \u0026 Closing The Window\n\nAlright, so let's break down this challenge\n1) We need a way to toggle whether the window is visible\n\t* We can use the display property (which can be set to none)\n\n2) We need to create a function to open the window \n\t* We can pass in an element and enable its visibility\n\n3) We need to create a function to close the window\n\t* We can pass in an element and disable its visibility\n\n4) Create buttons for opening \u0026 closing the window\n\t* using the onClick function on our elements we can run these functions\n\n### Identifying Our Window\nWe already have an id on our welcome window of \"welcome\".\n\nWe can identify it in JavaScript using a querySelector. \n\nIn our script.js file, let's select our window:\n```javascript\nvar welcomeScreen = document.querySelector(\"#welcome\")\n```\n\n### Close Window Function\nNext, let's create a function for disabling its visibility\n```javascript\nfunction closeWindow(element) {\n  element.style.display = \"none\"\n}\n```\n\nLet's break this down.\n\nFirst we're declaring that we're creating a function with the `function` keyword. Next, we're naming this function as `closeWindow` and passing in a parameter of `element`.\n\n![function explained](https://cloud-fe4ozqgl1-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0functionsexplained.gif)\n\nStill not sure what a function is?\n\u003cDropdown title=\"Explanation for the mathematical Hackers\"\u003e\n If you have a mathematical background (which to be clear, you don't need to understand this concept), you're probably already familiar with parameters. For example, if you have a function of f(x) you're passing the parameter of x into the f function and returning a value. \n \u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"Explanation for the non-mathematical Hackers (\u0026 those who like coffee)\"\u003e\nIf you don't have a mathematical background, think of a function like a machine with a certain task (let's say making a coffee) that is given parameters as to the specific order (like saying to make it have almond milk, Vermont maple syrup, etc) so the machine can have one operation but respond to the individual request accordingly. \n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\nWe take the element passed into the function, access the style property, and then the display property inside of the style property and change the value to \"none\" which hides it. \n\n### Open Window Function\nI typically make my windows with the display type of flex. If you try this \u0026 it breaks your window by stacking items horizontally, try adding the flex-direction: column property to your window element.\n\n```javascript\nfunction openWindow(element) {\n  element.style.display = \"flex\"\n}\n```\n\n*Note: If you don't want to use flex, you can also set the value of your windows to \"block\" and get the same effect.*\n\n*Note: If you still don't understand flex, play [the flex box froggy game](https://flexboxfroggy.com/)!*\n\n### Creating Window Buttons\n\n#### Creating Close Button\n![closeButton](https://cloud-ez4upags8-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0ezgif-4-aa4608bdb3.gif)\n\nLet's create a close button inside of our window:\n```html\n\t\u003cp style=\"cursor: pointer\" id=\"welcomeclose\"\u003eClose\u003c/p\u003e\n```\nFor now, I just created some text that says \"Close\".\n\n#### Creating Open Button\n![make Appear](https://cloud-k7h5sxshx-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0makeappear.gif)\n\nI am going to use the \"ThomasOS\" text in my top-bar to open the Welcome Screen, so I already have that button. \n\nI added an id of \"welcomeopen\"\n```html\n\t\u003cp style=\"cursor: pointer\" id=\"welcomeopen\"\u003eThomasOS\u003c/p\u003e\n```\n\nI encourage you to create your own button for opening the window if you'd like! You can put it in the top-bar, or opt not to. \n\n#### Identifying the buttons\nLet's select them with the IDs we created\n```javascript\nvar welcomeScreenClose = document.querySelector(\"#welcomeclose\")\n\nvar welcomeScreenOpen = document.querySelector(\"#welcomeopen\")\n```\n\n#### Adding Event Listeners\n![event listener](https://cloud-iddmheipf-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0ezgif-4-a94447ecbc.gif)\nAn event listener waits for a specific action to happen and then runs a function when said action happens. In this case, we're waiting for a click to trigger a function.\n\n```javascript\nwelcomeScreenClose.addEventListener(\"click\", function() {\n  closeWindow(welcomeScreen);\n});\n\nwelcomeScreenOpen.addEventListener(\"click\", function() {\n  openWindow(welcomeScreen);\n});\n\n```\n\n*Note: There are a lot of event listeners, but don't worry you don't need to memorize all of them. It may be fun to give a look at [this list of event listeners supported by the browser](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp)*\n\n#### Styling Your Close Button\nI made by button a red circle (this is a div with a set width and height, a border-radius, and a background-color). \n\nYou can make a circle or whatever else you'd like. You can even keep it as text if you'd like to.\n\n![my close button](https://cloud-ei3yo5kb7-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0currentversion.gif)\n\u003cDropdown title=\"My Code (don't steal\"\u003e\n```html\n    \u003cdiv id=\"welcomeheader\"\n      style=\"width: 100%; display: flex; align-items: center; cursor: grab; justify-content: space-between; margin-top: 8px;\"\u003e\n            \u003cdiv id=\"welcomeclose\" style=\"width: 16px; height: 16px; cursor: pointer; background-color: #EC6B5E; border-radius: 16px; border: solid 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25); margin-left: 6px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n      \u003cp style=\"margin: 0px; color: #fff; font-weight: 500\"\u003eWelcome\u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003cdiv style=\"width: 16px; margin-right: 6x; height: 16px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n## Organizing Our Styles\nWindows have a lot in common. Wouldn't it be so annoying \u0026 ineffective it would be if every time you created an application, you had to redefine the close button, the top-bar, etc.\n\nHow can we define the styles once and then just reuse infinitely? \n\n### Introducing CSS Classes\nSo you didn't know it, but all along you've been writing in-line CSS. There's another flavor of CSS which I am going to call class-based CSS *(because out-of-line CSS just sounds a bit strange)*\n\n1) We need to link our HTML file to our CSS file\n```html\n\u003chead\u003e\n  \u003cscript type=\"module\" src=\"./script.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"style.css\" /\u003e\n\u003c/head\u003e\n```\n2) We need to mark an object as belonging to a particular class in our HTML file inside the opening tag of an element \n```html\n    \u003cdiv class=\"closebutton\" id=\"welcomeheader\"\n      style=\"(styles)\"\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\n*Note: you can place classes on any element, not just divs*\n\n3) We need to go into our style.css file (which already exists btw) *(dw about dragElement.js, that shouldn't be on your screen)*\n![image of select style](https://cloud-9ll11kgre-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0selectstyles.gif)\n\n4) Inside of the style.css file we need to write . and then the name of the class and then place styles inside of the curly brackets `{}` on separate lines separated by a semicolon.\n```css\n.className {\n\tproperty1: 5;\n\tproperty2: \"16px\";\n\tproperty3: \"hidden\";\n}\n```\n\n5) Let's place our styles for our close button \n\n**Put your styles for the close button. DO NOT COPY THESE STYLES!**\n```css\n.closebutton {\n  width: 16px;\n  height: 16px;\n  cursor: pointer;\n  background-color: #EC6B5E;\n  border-radius: 16px;\n  border: solid 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);\n  margin-left: 6px;\n}\n```\n\n\n3) Let's now delete those in-line styles we put in the initial div \n```html\n\u003cdiv class=\"closebutton\" id=\"welcomeclose\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\nLet's now do the same for our window header and our window. We're doing this so we can easily add new windows without too much complexity. \n\n```html\n\u003cdiv class=\"window\" id=\"welcome\" style=\"top: calc(50% - 90px); left: calc(50% - 180px); \"\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"windowheader\" id=\"welcomeheader\"\u003e\n    ...\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n```\n\nWe may want to customize the positioning of the window, so I am leaving that as in-line and moving the rest to the CSS file:\n\nHere's what my new CSS classes look like (inside the CSS file):\n```css\n.window {\n  border: solid;\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n  border-radius: 16px;\n  position: absolute;\n  backdrop-filter: blur(4px);\n  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.125);\n}\n\n.windowheader {\n  width: 100%;\n  display: flex;\n  align-items: center;\n  cursor: grab;\n  justify-content: space-between;\n  margin-top: 8px;\n}\n\n.headertext {\n  margin: 0px;\n  color: #fff;\n  font-weight: 500\n}\n```\n\n**NOTE MAKE SURE YOU USE YOUR STYLES AND NOT MINE!!!** \n\nNow adding additional windows will be easy because we can mark those windows with the class property and automagically have the styles applied! \n\n## Next Episode...\nCongrats, your operating system is starting to feel quite real. You can now move, open, and close your welcome screen, but imagine how lame your computer would be if it could only open a single welcome screen! \n\nYou need to make your first app, and that's exactly what we'll be doing in our next episode.\n\nI'll see you there!"

Do whatever you'd like. \n\n**Outline:**\n1. **Adding App to Desktop**\n2. **Making App Icon Tappable** \n3. **Making our App Window** \n4. **Making Our First App** \n5. **Additional Challenges**\n\n## Adding App to Desktop\nAlrighty, so let's go into our body tag and create a div beneath the menu bar (hey, pro tip btw, you can collapse your divs to make your code more readable for cases like this by tapping the dropdown button next to the code line number of a div)\n\n```\n  \u003cdiv id=\"desktopApps\" style=\"padding-top: 64px; padding-left: 16px;\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eName Of Your App\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\nNote: I added some padding on the top and left to give the application icons some breathing room and to make sure it was not covered by the top-bar. \n\nHere's what my code looks like\n\n```html\n\u003cbody style=\"font-family: Noto Sans, system-ui, sans-serif; height: 100vh; background-image: url(./beautifulImage.png); background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat; margin: 0px;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cdiv class=\"window\" id=\"welcome\" style=\"top: calc(50% - 90px); left: calc(50% - 180px);\"\u003e\n\t\t(window content)\n\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\u003cdiv style=\"position: absolute; window: 100%; display: flex; backdrop-filter: blur(10px); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.125); color: #fff; justify-content: space-between; gap: 32px;\"\u003e\n\t\t(topbar content)\n\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\u003cdiv id=\"desktopApps\" style=\"padding-top: 64px; padding-left: 16px;\"\u003e\n\t\t\u003cp\u003eHacker Notes\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/body\u003e\n```\n### Add Your Icon\n#### Create an Icon\nMy app is going to be called Hacker Notes. \n\nNote: Want to also name your app Hacker Notes? Ha, no you cannot because you're not doing a workshop, you're doing a **JAM** and **JAMS** require that you do-ya-own-thing™. \n\nI took a photo of a friend's notebook *(note from Thomas's \"friend\", Sahiti: \"WHY MY NOTEBOOK?!\")* to use as the icon for the app. \n\n![notebook image](https://iili.io/HPLAlyP.md.png)\n\nTake your own image that fits your app and send it to your computer using email or AirDrop and then drag it into Replit (just as we did for the background). Make sure the file format is .png or .jpg (otherwise find an online file converter). \n\nYou can also you can icon you create or find online. I really don't mind, this is your operating system after all and you're the chief designing, so you make the call pal. \n\n#### Use Your Icon\nCreate an image tag, and apply some styles of your choice! I customized the width, height, border-radius, and added a drop-shadow. \n\nIt's also probably a good idea to wrap your icon in a div so we can later tap on that icon to open the window. \n\nHere's what my code looks like:\n```\n  \u003cdiv id=\"desktopApps\" style=\"padding-top: 64px;\"\u003e\n    \u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center; padding: 16px; filter: drop-shadow(0 0 8px black); width: fit-content\"\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"./notebook.png\" style=\"width: 64px; height: 64px; border-radius: 16px;\"\u003e\n      \u003cp style=\"margin: 0px; color: #fff; \"\u003eNotes\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\nNote: PLEASE DO NOT COPY THIS CODE! Do your own app and style your icon in your own way. Want to make all the icons circles, go for it (increase that border-radius)! \n\nHere's what my icon is currently looking like inside my application\n\n![Icon in my personalOS](https://cloud-9y8sc20z9-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-06-26_at_4.39.55_pm.png)\n\nCurrently when we tap on the icon... nothing happens. Let's select the icon when we tap on it! \n\n### Making App Icon Tappable\nAlright let's break this into parts.\n\n1. Store what icon is selected\n2. We need a way to communicate to the user whether the icon is selected or not selected\n3. We need a way to change the icon's appearance to show that it is selected\n4. We also need a way to change the appearance when deselected (tapped that second time) \n#### Store the State of the Selected Icon\nLet's begin by storing what the selected icon is (by default, this will be undefined because there is no selected icon).\n\nFor that we will use a... you guessed it... variable \n\n```javascript\nvar selectedIcon = undefined\n```\n*(p.s. this is JavaScript code, so it's in our JavaScript file)*\n\nLovely, now let's make a function for changing the visual appearance of the icon. I challenge you to give it some thought \u0026 think hmmm \"how can I change the style of an icon without using in-line styles\".\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"Solution\"\u003e\nClasses, wahooo!!!\n\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n#### Communicate whether an icon is selected\nWe're going to this using classes! \n\nLet's make a class for a selected icon. For testing purposes, you can go ahead and add the class to your icon div like so:\n\n```html\n\u003cdiv class=\"selected\" styles=\"(styles)\"\u003e\n\t(content)\n\u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\nHere's what I added in my css file. Please DON'T TAKE THIS CODE. Communicate that it is selected in your own way. This may be through a curvy underline, a rounding of the corners, a green background, etc whatever you'd like!\n\n#### Programmatically Adding/Removing a Class\nPoke around this [geeksforgeeks site on classes](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript-adding-a-class-name-to-the-element/) and see if you can programmatically add a class to an element \n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"Solution\"\u003e\nUse the `element.classList.add(\"newClass\");`` to add a class\n\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\nLet's go ahead and add some style properties for when the icon is selected. \n\n```javascript\nfunction selectIcon(element) {\n  element.classList.add(\"selected\");\n  selectedIcon = element\n} \n```\n\n\u0026 now try implementing a function for deselecting an icon\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"Solution for Deselecting Icon function\"\u003e\n```javascript\nfunction deselectIcon(element) {\n  element.classList.remove(\"selected\");\n  selectedIcon = undefined\n}\n```\n\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n\n\nWhen I first introduced JavaScript, I described it as the logic of your program. \n\nI think we've already worked with if else statements, but just in case you were lost, here's a brief introduction.\n\nIf else statements check if a certain condition is true in which case a certain block of code runs \u0026 if that condition is not true a different block of code runs.\n\nTry to write an if-then statement inside a `handleIconTap` function that selects the item if it's not selected, but deselects it if it is already selected.\n\nYour code may look a little like this:\n```javascript\nfunction handleIconTap(element) {\n  if (condition) {\n    functionA(element)\n  } else {\n    functionB(element)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n*Hint: `element.classList.contains(\"selected\")` exists and returns a Boolean value (either True or False)*\n \n\u003cDropdown title=\"Solution Handling Icon Tap\"\u003e\n```javascript\nfunction handleIconTap(element) {\n  if (element.classList.contains(\"selected\")) {\n    deselectIcon(element)\n    openWindow(window)\n  } else {\n    selectIcon(element)\n  }\n}\n```\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n\n## Making our App Window\n### Copying \u0026 customizing the old window\nWe can basically copy the code from our other window and remove the content. \n\nOnce we copy that code, change the id to \"theNameOfYourApp\" (actually make it the name of your app). Then inside the div that contains the content of your app, you may want to adjust the height and width.  You can also change the header text. \n\nHere's what my code looks like (keep in mind if you copy this code it will probably break your site because it should have significantly different styling than what is here)\n\n(don't copy)\n```html\n  \u003cdiv class=\"window\" id=\"notes\" style=\"top: calc(50% - 240px); left: calc(50% - 260px); \"\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"windowheader\" id=\"notesheader\"\u003e\n      \u003cdiv class=\"closebutton\" id=\"notesclose\"\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n\n      \u003cp class=\"headertext\"\u003eNotes\u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003cdiv style=\"width: 16px; margin-right: 6x; height: 16px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003cdiv style=\"background-color: #fff; margin: 6px; border-radius: 12px; width: 520px; height: 480px; padding: 16px;\"\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003eHacker Notes\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\n```\n\n### Making our App Draggable\n\nAlso make sure to run in your script.js file the code \n```javascript\ndragElement(document.querySelector(\"#notes\"))\n```\njust as you did with your other window. \n\nBoommmm, we have our second window!\n\nNow we're able to move it around, but we cannot yet close it. \n\n![Draggable](https://cloud-j9a1i26ly-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0draggable.gif)\n\n### Making our App Closable\n\nLet's look at the code we implemented for the welcome screen\n```javascript\nvar welcomeScreen = document.querySelector(\"#welcome\")\n\nvar notesScreenClose = document.querySelector(\"#welcomeclose\")\n\nnotesScreenClose.addEventListener(\"click\", () =\u003e closeWindow(welcomeScreen));\n```\n\nNow try editing your HTML code id (for the close button) and write a new set of code for making this screen closable\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"Solution For Closing The Window\"\u003e\n```javascript\nvar notesScreen = document.querySelector(\"#notes\")\n\nvar notesScreenClose = document.querySelector(\"#notesclose\")\n\nnotesScreenClose.addEventListener(\"click\", () =\u003e closeWindow(notesScreen));\n```\n\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n![make the window closable](https://cloud-76crcv3i9-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0closable.gif)\n\nSoo... this is quite annoying... repeating code that is...\n\nWhen you repeat code, that's a good sign you should make it a function. Try turning it into a function and calling said function\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"Solution For Closable Window Function\"\u003e\n```javascript\nvar notesScreen = document.querySelector(\"#notes\")\n\nvar notesScreenClose = document.querySelector(\"#notesclose\")\n\nnotesScreenClose.addEventListener(\"click\", () =\u003e closeWindow(notesScreen));\n```\n\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n### Making Our Window Closed By Default\nThis is quite simple! Just add the `display: none;` style property inline to your notes div. \n\n![closed by default](https://cloud-8h1gc5y7n-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0closed_default_.gif)\n\n### Making our Rise To The Top\nYou'll notice on that last gif that when we tap on the notes window, it doesn't rise on top of the welcome screen. \n\nWhen we tap on a window, we should make it rise to the top. We can do this using the [z-index style property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index).\n\nIf you're feeling quite confident, try implementing this feature on your own! Otherwise, go through the notes below\n\n#### Defining the largest index\nWe need to store the largest index so we can know what value we need to set the tapped on window to. We want the window we tap on to have an index greater than the one previously tapped on. \n\n```javascript\nvar biggestIndex = 1;\n```\nI initialized it at 1. You can initialize the variable at any value you'd like to initialize it at. \n\n#### Checking for a Tap on the window\nWe need a function to make the window listen for the user to click on it (we call this `\"mousedown\"`). When the user taps on the window, we then run the will run some block of code (`handleWindowTap`) to move it to the top\n\n```javascript\nfunction addWindowTapHandling(element) {\n  element.addEventListener(\"mousedown\", () =\u003e\n    handleWindowTap(element)\n  )\n}\n```\n\nRemember to call the addWindowTapHandling for each of your elements (so for example addWindowTapHandling(welcomeScreen) and addWindowTapHandling(notesScreen)\n#### Making the Window to the Top On Move on Tap\nWe're now lifting the window up to the top by incrementing the biggestIndex and setting the zIndex to that new `biggestIndex`\n\n```javascript\nfunction handleWindowTap(element) {\n  biggestIndex++;  // Increment biggestIndex by 1\n  element.style.zIndex = biggestIndex;\n}\n```\n#### Making Window Move To Top On Open\nAwesome, we want to make it so when we open the window, it moves straight to the top immediately. \n\n```javascript\nfunction openWindow(element) {\n  element.style.display = \"flex\";\n  biggestIndex++;  // Increment biggestIndex by 1\n  element.style.zIndex = biggestIndex;\n}\n```\n\n#### Protecting The Top Bar\nAn issue we encounter is that eventually the window goes on top of the topBar. To counter that, let's identify the top bar and then increment it's value each time we increment the window\n\n```html\n\u003cdiv id=\"top\"\n    style=\"(styles)\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\n```\n(in HTML)\n\n```javascript\nvar topBar = document.querySelector(\"#top\")\n\nfunction openWindow(element) {\n  element.style.display = \"flex\";\n  biggestIndex++;  // Increment biggestIndex by 1\n  element.style.zIndex = biggestIndex;\n  topBar.style.zIndex = biggestIndex + 1;\n}\n\nfunction handleWindowTap(element) {\n  biggestIndex++;  // Increment biggestIndex by 1\n  element.style.zIndex = biggestIndex;\n  topBar.style.zIndex = biggestIndex + 1;\n  deselectIcon(selectedIcon)\n}\n```\n(in JavaScript) \n\n### Celebrate it works\nAwesome! Now we're able to tap on our windows and see them ov\n\n![overlapping fixed](https://cloud-fok3p0igt-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0overlapfix.gif)\n\n\n### Putting All Of This Into One Function to Initialize a Window\nWe're writing a bunch of functions to initialize the window, I challenge you to try putting it all into one window. This isn't necessary, but it will just be helpful later on. \n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"Solution\"\u003e\n```\nfunction initializeWindow(elementName) {\n  var screen = document.querySelector(\"#\" + elementName)\n  addWindowTapHandling(screen)\n  makeClosable(elementName)\n  dragElement(screen)\n}\n```\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n### Calling Our Function \nMake sure you call the function you create to ensure your window functions properly \n`initializeWindow(\"notes\")`\n\n## Making Our First App\nThe time has come young one. You're going to make the first app for your OS. It's going to be a text-based app about whatever you'd like. Mine will be my \"Hacker Notes,\" but maybe yours will be your \"Hiking Notes\" or your \"Favorite Recipes,\" or your \"Random Inspirational Quotes.\"\n\nIt's totally up to you. There's only one app you cannot make (\u0026 that is Hacker Notes). You need to do your ownnnn thinggg my friend! Don't be a follower, be a leader!!!\n\n### Making Initial View\nThe initial view for my site will be introducing the concept of Hacker Notes. If you would like, you can make an initial view that represents your site well. I changed the font, added some text, and just generally had fun with it. I encourage you to do the same (\u0026 add your own unique style with images, awesome styles, etc).\n\n![initial screen](https://cloud-5atxrow99-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-06-28_at_11.30.46_am.png)\n\n### Adding Content Selection\nHaving one piece of content on your app is sort of boring. We should make it so the user can select between multiple pieces of content.\n\n#### Creating a side bar, bottom bar, top bar, or whatever you'd like \nYou need a space to store your content selection options. I put this in a side bar. You can put this in whatever you'd like. \n\n![side bar added](https://cloud-9djehu11s-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-06-28_at_11.44.56_am.png)\n\nI encourage you to create something other than a sidebar to display your content selection options. Get creative, and be unique.\n\nHere are the steps I took to create this sidebar.\n1. Wrapped my text content inside of a div \n2. Created a div inside of the window content div\n3. Made the window content div use `display: flex;` and `flex-direction: row;`\n4. Added some padding and some margin\n5. Styled the sidebar to make it look nice and added the first entry (with a name and date)\n\nIf you're stuck and want to see my code, take a look (but please don't copy and paste)\n\n```html\n  \u003cdiv class=\"window\" id=\"notes\" style=\"top: calc(50% - 240px); display: none; left: calc(50% - 260px); \"\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"windowheader\" id=\"notesheader\"\u003e\n      \u003cdiv class=\"closebutton\" id=\"notesclose\"\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n\n      \u003cp class=\"headertext\"\u003eNotes\u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003cdiv style=\"width: 16px; margin-right: 6x; height: 16px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003cdiv\n      style=\"background-color: #fff; margin: 6px; border-radius: 12px; width: 520px; height: 480px; padding: 16px; font-family: Courier; display: flex;\"\u003e\n      \u003cdiv style=\"background-color: #F9F9F9; width: 520px; margin-right: 16px; padding: 16px; border-radius: 16px;\"\u003e\n        \u003cp style=\"margin: 0px;\"\u003eWelcome\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp style=\"font-size: 12px; margin: 0px;\"\u003e06/28/2023\u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n\n      \u003cdiv style=\"overflow-y: scroll;\"\u003e\n        \u003cp contenteditable=\"True\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan contenteditable=\"true\"\u003eWelcome to \u003cstrong\u003eHacker Notes\u003c/strong\u003e\n            \u003c/br\u003e\n            \u003c/br\u003e\n            \u003cimg src=\"https://cloud-pc8imajxj-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0img_0837.jpg\"\n              style=\"width: 96px; border-radius: 16px\" /\u003e\n            \u003c/br\u003e\n            \u003c/br\u003e\n\n            This is a place where I store my thoughts as they come to mind.

What data you'll have inside of each object will vary depending on what you're making.\n\nFor example, your objects may have a property of music if your app will display different songs for piece of content selected. \n\nAn object is a collection of properties (or smaller pieces of data) \n```javascript\n{\n\ttitle: \"Welcome\",\n\tdate: \"06/28/2023\",\n\tcontent: `(a bunch of html content in my case)`\n}\n```\n\n`title` for example is a property and `\"Welcome\"` is the value of that property.\n\n*Note: I used ` `` ` instead of ` \" \" `  to ensure that the quotations inside of my html code would not prematurely end the string*\n\n#### Storing our content\nWe don't want to hard code the content, rather we want the content to be programmatically added to the screen so we can easily change it. \n\nLet's begin by commenting out our HTML code and pasting it into our Java Script object. We'll have an object for each post. \n```javascript\nvar content = [\n  {\n    title: \"Welcome\",\n    date: \"06/28/2023\",\n    content: `\n              \u003cp contenteditable=\"True\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan contenteditable=\"true\"\u003eWelcome to \u003cstrong\u003eHacker Notes\u003c/strong\u003e\n            \u003c/br\u003e\n            \u003c/br\u003e\n            \u003cimg src=\"https://cloud-pc8imajxj-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0img_0837.jpg\"\n              style=\"width: 96px; border-radius: 16px\" /\u003e\n            \u003c/br\u003e\n            \u003c/br\u003e\n\n            This is a place where I store my thoughts as they come to mind.

It's time we take off those training wheels and let you ride into the wind...\n\n![riding into the wind](https://cloud-1cmmfb0q5-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0the-penny-farthing-bike-race-vintage.gif)\n\nToday you're going to be building an app for your personalOS and you'll be given pretty little guidance. **YOU GET TO DECIDE THE CONTENT AND FEATURES FOR THIS APP.** You're probably a bit nervous.\n\nDon't worry, I'll be riding alongside you. I also don't know what app I am going to build. Fear not young one, we'll figure it out together. Be brave. You've been so brave up to this point and I am so proud of what you've built. Here's what I built, but I assure you that your final product will be nothing like this:\n\n![final product](https://cloud-1ovz11fvq-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0photo.gif)\n\nMake sure you have some paper! Let's do this!\n\n**Outline:** \n1. **Ideation** *(figure out what we're going to build)*\n2. **Wireframe** *(make some sketches)*\n3. **Build Your App** *(build an awesome app for our OS)*\n\n## Ideation\nYou finally get to create your own app. It could be an app to do whatever you'd like! Here are some ideas (but I encourage you to come up with your own ideas):\n* **Contact App** *(helps people get in contact w/ you)*\n* **Projects App** *(shows all projects you've been)*\n* **Map App** *(shows your life story on a map)*\n* **Weather App** *(shows your local weather?)*\n\n### Brainstorming on Paper\nLet's begin by mind mapping on paper for ten minutes!\n\n#### What is Mind Mapping?\nA mind map is basically a visualization of a bunch of your ideas. It helps you be creative and explore ideas that would have otherwise never surfaced.\n\nA question/prompt in the center of the map will provide us with some degree of direction and ideas will radiate from the center of our sheet. \n\nI found this example for you by browsing the internet:\n![example of a mind map](https://cloud-i3lmaxn11-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)\nimage from an [IDEO article about Mind Maps](https://www.ideo.com/blog/build-your-creative-confidence-mindmaps)\n\nYour Mind Map doesn't have to be quite as big and crazy. Let's put in the center of our sheet of paper \"What do I want people who visit my site to walk away knowing about me?.\" \n\n![question in the circle](https://cloud-dfm3s8clg-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0img_1302-2.png)\n\nWhen an answer comes to mind, draw it around the circle and then connect it to the center. Write down as many ideas as possible\n\n![a new idea](https://cloud-ff7mcajxn-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0img_1304.jpg)\n\nCreate a string of ideas \u0026 be sure to go for quantity over quality (no idea is too crazy for the mind map)\n\n![question with some answers](https://cloud-on92ke5el-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0img_1306.jpg)\n\n\u0026 then go wild with it!\n\n![complete mind map](https://cloud-bg351r0tv-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0img_1309.jpg)\n\n(your answers should \u0026 will be quite different than mine, and that's good) (have fun with it)\n\n[Here's a ten minute timer](https://www.google.com/search?q=10min+timer\u0026rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS1062US1062\u0026oq=10min+timer+\u0026gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqCggAEAAYsQMYgAQyCggAEAAYsQMYgAQyBwgBEAAYgAQyBwgCEAAYgAQyBwgDEAAYgAQyBwgEEAAYgAQyBwgFEAAYgAQyBwgGEAAYgAQyBwgHEAAYgAQyBwgIEAAYgAQyCggJEAAYhgMYigXSAQgxMjc4ajBqNKgCALACAA\u0026sourceid=chrome\u0026ie=UTF-8), good luck!\n\n#### Turning Brain Dump into ~~Beautiful~~ App\n\nYou probably now have an idea in your mind for something you'd love to convey inside your site after making that Mind Map. You may also have an idea for what that app would look like (if not, take a moment to consider what you might build to achieve your desired effect on the user).\n\nI decided to try to create an image that contains almost every element of my life and then make it interactive so the user can tap on sections of the image to learn a bit more about me. Please make an app that is totally different! This app will be your App and should not look like my App. \n\nTo begin, let's map out what a typical user experience will look like in terms of how they will flow through your App (this will vary depending on your App)\n\n ![App Flow](https://cloud-dxudaq5de-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0img_1311.jpg)\n\nLet's create a wireframe to flesh out our ideas a bit more.\n\n## Wireframe\nA wireframe is sort of a sketch of your app. You can sketch however you'd like, but the way I do it is by drawing shapes (like rectangles, circles, etc) that represent text, images, etc. \n\n![Insert image of the wireframe](https://cloud-1ungcc4hw-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0img_1314.jpg)\n\nSketches are really just for you, so do whatever you like. Just make sure you can draw them as fast as possible.\n\nI am also going to take a moment to ideate what items I would like to include in the image. This is a higher fidelity version of the initial wireframe. \n\n![](https://cloud-i8dp56cio-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0img_1317.jpg)\n\nBecause I am not currently at home (I am at a Cafe across from Hack Club HQ), I am going to work with a prototype image. This will also just make it much easier to build the first version \u0026 then scale from there. \n\n![Empty Table](https://cloud-649y4sz8h-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0img_1315.jpg)\n\nI hope your app is totally different. If your app requires a lot of content that you don't have, try making it placeholder content for the time being. \n\n### Vision Secured\nAwesome, hopefully you have secured your vision for the application. \n\nNext up, we'll be making the app icon \u0026 window (but it will be fast because of the work we did in our last Jam).\n\n#### Creating App Icon\nIf we copy our previous icon and paste it beneath the previous icon...\n![copy \u0026 paste](https://cloud-nl08nicka-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0copypaste.gif)\n\nwow, that was easy! Now we have our second icon on the screen!\n\nLet's customize it to the name \u0026 image of our app! (import an image you'd like to use as your icon) (feel free to steal an image off the internet or create your own beautiful icon (or anything in-between))\n\n![not tappable](https://cloud-p2xdz2i3j-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0tap_icon.gif)\n\n```\n    \u003cdiv id=\"photoIcon\"\n      style=\"text-align: center; margin: 8px; padding: 8px; filter: drop-shadow(0 0 8px black); width: fit-content; cursor: pointer;\"\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"./photo.png\" style=\"width: 64px; height: 64px; border-radius: 16px;\"\u003e\n      \u003cp style=\"margin: 0px; color: #fff; \"\u003eLife.png\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\nGreat, but now we're not able to tap on our icon! We need to initialize the icon.\n\nHere's our old code:\n```\nvar notesIcon = document.querySelector(\"#notesIcon\")\nvar notesScreen = document.querySelector(\"#notes\")\n\nnotesIcon.addEventListener(\"click\", () =\u003e handleIconTap(notesIcon, notesScreen));\n\n```\n\nLet's try turning it into a function so we do not have to rewrite this code for our new icon. I challenge you to give it a shot! \n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"Solution\"\u003e\n    ```//Replace Old Code with This New Code\nfunction initializeIcon(name) {\n  var icon = document.querySelector(\"#\" + name + \"Icon\")\n  var screen = document.querySelector(\"#\" + name)\n  icon.addEventListener(\"click\", () =\u003e handleIconTap(icon, screen));\n}\ninitializeIcon(\"notes\")\n```\n\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\nNow if you want to be really *nifty*, try making it so we initialize the window, we initialize the icon too \n\n(hint: it's only a 2-3 line change)\n\n\u003cDropdown title=\"Solution\"\u003e\n    ```//Include initializeIcon function in initializeWindow for when it's not the welcome screen (because welcomeScreen has no icon)\nfunction initializeWindow(elementName) {\n  var screen = document.querySelector(\"#\" + elementName)\n  addWindowTapHandling(screen)\n  makeClosable(elementName)\n  dragElement(screen)\n  if(elementName != \"welcome\") {\n    initializeIcon(elementName)  \n  }\n}\ninitializeWindow(\"welcome\")\ninitializeWindow(\"notes\")\n```\n\u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n\n#### Creating Our App Window\nBefore we can initialize the window, we actually need to create it. Let's copy the code from the welcome window and then just delete the content and change the id of the application to the name of this app.\n\n```\n\n  \u003cdiv class=\"window\" id=\"photo\" style=\"top: calc(50% - 90px); left: calc(50% - 180px); display: none; \"\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"windowheader\" id=\"photoheader\"\u003e\n      \u003cdiv class=\"closebutton\" id=\"photoclose\"\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n\n      \u003cp class=\"headertext\"\u003ePhoto\u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003cdiv style=\"width: 16px; margin-right: 6x; height: 16px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003cdiv style=\"background-color: #fff; margin: 6px; border-radius: 12px; width: 360px; padding: 16px;\"\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003eHello World\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\n\u0026 then if in our javascript we call our initialize window function with our new app...\n\n```\ninitializeWindow(\"photo\")\n```\n\nBOOOYAHHHH, OUR SECOND WINDOW IS LIVEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!! WE'RE FULLY SETUP!\n![new icon](https://cloud-96f6252ll-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0newicon.gif)\n\n## Build Your App\nOkay now for the fun part... build your app. No hand holding here, you've built an app before and I know you can do it again. I encourage you to have fun \u0026 try to make an amazing app for your personalOS!\n\n## You Built It, Congrats! \nThanks for coming along this journey. I honestly was not expecting you to make it this far. Here's what my app ended up looking like:\n\n![final product](https://cloud-1ovz11fvq-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0photo.gif)\n\nI hope you continue building apps for your personalOS \u0026 just generally have fun with it, but more importantly I hope you leave this batch with the urge to develop sites not just for yourself, but for other people! Building tools that help make the lives of others better is a task within reach given the fact that you made it all the way through this rigorous batch of Jams. I'm proud of you, and I hope you're proud of yourself. Have a great day, and keep Jamming!\n\n"
